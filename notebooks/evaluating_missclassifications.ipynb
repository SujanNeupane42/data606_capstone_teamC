      " TITLE: Angry and inspired: Democrats train new wave of candidates\n",
      "TEXT: ROCKVILLE, Md. (Reuters) - The 100 Democratic women who packed into a suburban Maryland conference room recently for a one-day training on how to run for political office were more than activists eager to battle President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans. The teachers, students and business leaders were also a window into the future for a Democratic Party desperate for new blood, and into the booming effort to turn the left’s grassroots anti-Trump activism into a new wave of Democratic officeholders. As thousands of potential first-time candidates explore  political bids in what Democratic veterans say is an unprecedented surge of activity, a broad but informal network of groups is beefing up efforts to train them for the task. The goal: turning neophytes into successful politicians who can win, giving the party a deep and diverse bench of up-and-coming progressive talent at all levels of government. “This era of Trump has made everybody just want to run for office, and it’s not easy,” said Josh Morrow, executive director of 314 Action, which since its founding last year has heard from about 6,000 scientists, engineers and mathematicians exploring  political runs and trained nearly 500 of them. “No matter how accomplished people are, they need help when they first run,” Morrow said. The surge of interest has given dispirited Democrats, long criticized as a top-heavy party lacking fresh faces, hope for a renaissance at the local and state levels after repeated setbacks under President Barack Obama. Building from the ground up, from the school board to the statehouse, is a party priority after losing nearly 1,000 state legislative seats in the last eight years. Republicans also control the White House, both chambers of Congress and 33 governor’s offices, the most in nearly a century. “Local offices matter, and as Democrats we have sort of forgotten that,” said Amanda Litman, a staffer on Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign who founded the group Run for Something after the 2016 election to recruit and prepare millennials for office. For first-timers, the initial enthusiasm for public service can quickly give way to worried questions about the logistics of building a fundraising list, utilizing social media and crafting a message. “I knew I had a steep learning curve,” said Thereasa Black, a lawyer and Navy veteran running for the U.S. Congress from Maryland. She attended the Rockville session run by Emerge America, which prepares women for office. “This is a way to find people who are like-minded and going through what you are, and can help you,” she said. A Republican spokesman said Democrats would need more than training and fresh faces to gain ground in next year’s midterm elections given the losses of first-time Democratic candidates in special congressional races in Georgia and Montana earlier this year. “The challenges that Democrats face go much deeper and come down to fundraising and messaging,” said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, which sponsored a training program for about 4,500 volunteer field staff and operatives last year. Geoffrey Dittberner, 30, said he had volunteered on campaigns before deciding to run for the Minnesota legislature, but he was still unprepared for being a candidate before he was accepted into Run for Something’s training program. “There were so many things I didn’t know - fundraising, setting up a campaign organization - but they made it pretty easy,” he said. The group’s Slack application gave him access to a variety of resources, from tutorials to mentors and peer networks, discussion groups and on-call experts, he said. Aside from new groups like 314 Action and Run for Something, about a dozen established organizations that have long offered training to progressive candidates also have been flooded with interest since Trump’s election. Emily’s List, which for years has trained women candidates who favor abortion rights, has hired five more staffers this year for a reconstituted training unit. It already has heard from 16,000 women interested in becoming candidates this year, compared to 920 in 2016. Emerge America has seen applications jump by 87 percent and added five new state chapters. The Maryland state chapter, which ran the one-day course in Rockville, had trained 250 women by mid-year. Last year, it trained 55. At Emerge’s Rockville session, candidates were encouraged to listen more than they talk and delve into their own experiences to explain what motivated them to run. “When we tap into our own personal story, we relate better to people in our community,” Diane Fink, executive director for Emerge Maryland, told the class. She asked them to put together a three-minute story that explains how they got started. While Democrats nationally have battled over their core message, most of the training programs say they avoid telling candidates specifically what issues to emphasize. “First and foremost you should be talking about what matters to voters, not to you,” said veteran Democratic strategist Kelly Dietrich, who founded the National Democratic Training Committee last year to offer free online training for any Democrat running for any office. So far, more than 6,000 have signed up. \n",

      " TITLE: Text: Mitt Romney speech slamming Donald Trump\n",
      "TEXT: (Reuters) - The following is the full text of the speech delivered on Thursday by former Massachusetts Governor and 2012 Republican nominee for U.S. president Mitt Romney to the Institute of Politics at the University of Utah. I am not here to announce my candidacy for office.  I am not going to endorse a candidate today. Instead, I would like to offer my perspective on the nominating process of my party. In 1964, days before the presidential election which, incidentally, we lost, Ronald Reagan went on national television and challenged America saying that it was a “Time for Choosing.” He saw two paths for America, one that embraced conservative principles dedicated to lifting people out of poverty and helping create opportunity for all, and the other, an oppressive government that would lead America down a darker, less free path. I’m no Ronald Reagan and this is a different moment but I believe with all my heart and soul that we face another time for choosing, one that will have profound consequences for the Republican Party and more importantly, for the country. I say this in part because of my conviction that America is poised to lead the world for another century. Our technology engines, our innovation dynamic, and the ambition and skill of our people will propel our economy and raise our standard of living. America will remain as it is today, the envy of the world. Warren Buffett was 100% right when he said last week that “the babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.” That doesn’t mean we don’t have real problems and serious challenges. At home, poverty persists and wages are stagnant. The horrific massacres of Paris and San Bernardino, the nuclear ambitions of the Iranian mullahs, the aggressions of Putin, the growing assertiveness of China and the nuclear tests of North Korea confirm that we live in troubled and dangerous times. But if we make the right choices, America’s future will be even better than our past and better than our present. On the other hand, if we make improvident choices, the bright horizon I foresee will never materialize. Let me put it plainly, if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished. Let me explain why. First, the economy: If Donald Trump’s plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into a prolonged recession. A few examples: His proposed 35% tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war that would raise prices for consumers, kill export jobs, and lead entrepreneurs and businesses to flee America. His tax plan, in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt. So even as Donald Trump has offered very few specific economic plans, what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families. But wait, you say, isn’t he a huge business success that knows what he’s talking about? No he isn’t. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them. He inherited his business, he didn’t create it. And what ever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there’s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not. Now not every policy Donald Trump has floated is bad. He wants to repeal and replace Obamacare. He wants to bring jobs home from China and Japan. But his prescriptions to do these things are flimsy at best.  At the last debate, all he could remember about his healthcare plan was to remove insurance boundaries between states. Successfully bringing jobs home requires serious policy and reforms that make America the place businesses want to plant and grow. You can’t punish business into doing the things you want. Frankly, the only serious policy proposals that deal with the broad range of national challenges we confront, come today from Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich. One of these men should be our nominee.  I know that some people want the race to be over. They look at history and say a trend like Mr. Trump’s isn’t going to be stopped. Perhaps. But the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign. If the other candidates can find common ground, I believe we can nominate a person who can win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism. Given the current delegate selection process, this means that I would vote for Marco Rubio in Florida, for John Kasich in Ohio, and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state. Let me turn to national security and the safety of our homes and loved ones. Trump’s bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies. Insulting all Muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in the urgent fight against ISIS. And for what purpose? Muslim terrorists would only have to lie about their religion to enter the country. What he said on “60 Minutes” about Syria and ISIS has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the campaign season: Let ISIS take out Assad, he said, and then we can pick up the remnants. Think about that: Let the most dangerous terror organization the world has ever known take over a country? This is recklessness in the extreme. Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart. I’m afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very, very not smart. I am far from the first to conclude that Donald Trump lacks the temperament of be president.  After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who attributed a reporter’s questions to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity. Donald Trump says he admires Vladimir Putin, while has called George W. Bush a liar. That is a twisted example of evil trumping good. There is dark irony in his boasts of his sexual exploits during the Vietnam War while John McCain, whom he has mocked, was imprisoned and tortured. Dishonesty is Trump’s hallmark: He claimed that he had spoken clearly and boldly against going into Iraq. Wrong, he spoke in favor of invading Iraq. He said he saw thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating 9/11. Wrong, he saw no such thing.  He imagined it. His is not the temperament of a stable, thoughtful leader. His imagination must not be married to real power. The President of the United States has long been the leader of the free world. The president and yes the nominees of the country’s great parties help define America to billions of people. All of them bear the responsibility of being an example for our children and grandchildren. Think of Donald Trump’s personal qualities, the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third grade theatrics. We have long referred to him as “The Donald.” He is the only person in America to whom we have added an article before his name. It wasn’t because he had attributes we admired. Now imagine your children and your grandchildren acting the way he does.  Will you welcome that?  Haven’t we seen before what happens when people in prominent positions fail the basic responsibility of honorable conduct?  We have, and it always injures our families and our country. Watch how he responds to my speech today. Will he talk about our policy differences or will he attack me with every imaginable low road insult? This may tell you what you need to know about his temperament, his stability, and his suitability to be president. Trump relishes any poll that reflects what he thinks of himself. But polls are also saying that he will lose to Hillary Clinton.   On Hillary Clinton’s watch at the State Department, America’s interests were diminished in every corner of the world. She compromised our national secrets, dissembled to the families of the slain, and jettisoned her most profound beliefs to gain presidential power.  For the last three decades, the Clintons have lived at the intersection of money and politics, trading their political influence to enrich their personal finances. They embody the term “crony capitalism.” It disgusts the American people and causes them to lose faith in our political process.  A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as Hillary Clinton must not become president. But a Trump nomination enables her victory.  The audio and video of the infamous Tapper-Trump exchange on the Ku Klux Klan will play a hundred thousand times on cable and who knows how many million times on social media.  There are a number of people who claim that Mr. Trump is a con man, a fake. There is indeed evidence of that. Mr. Trump has changed his positions not just over the years, but over the course of the campaign, and on the Ku Klux Klan, daily for three days in a row. We will only really know if he is the real deal or a phony if he releases his tax returns and the tape of his interview with the New York Times. I predict that there are more bombshells in his tax returns. I predict that he doesn’t give much if anything to the disabled and to our veterans. I predict that he told the New York Times that his immigration talk is just that: talk. And I predict that despite his promise to do so, first made over a year ago, he will never ever release his tax returns. Never.  Not the returns under audit, not even the returns that are no longer being audited. He has too much to hide. Nor will he authorize the Times to release the tapes. If I’m right, you will have all the proof you need to know that Donald Trump is a phony. Attacking me as he surely will won’t prove him any less of a phony. It’s entirely in his hands to prove me wrong. All he has to do is to release his back taxes like he promised he would, and let us hear what he said behind closed doors to the New York Times. Ronald Reagan used to quote a Scottish philosopher who predicted that democracies and civilizations couldn’t last more than about 200 years. John Adams wrote this: “Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.” I believe that America has proven these dire predictions wrong for two reasons. First, we have been blessed with great presidents, with giants among us. Men of character, integrity and selflessness have led our nation from its very beginning. None were perfect: each surely made mistakes. But in every case, they acted out of the desire to do what was right for America and for freedom. The second reason is because we are blessed with a great people, people who at every critical moment of choosing have put the interests of the country above their own.  These two things are related: our presidents time and again have called on us to rise to the occasion. John F. Kennedy asked us to consider what we could do for our country. Lincoln drew upon the better angels of our nature to save the union.  I understand the anger Americans feel today. In the past, our presidents have channeled that anger, and forged it into resolve, into endurance and high purpose, and into the will to defeat the enemies of freedom. Our anger was transformed into energy directed for good.  Mr. Trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes. He creates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants, he calls for the use of torture and for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists.  He cheers assaults on protesters. He applauds the prospect of twisting the Constitution to limit first amendment freedom of the press. This is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss. Here’s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He’s playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat. His domestic policies would lead to recession. His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president. And his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.  America has greatness ahead. This is a time for choosing. God bless us to choose a nominee who will make that vision a reality.  \n",

      " TITLE: Trump accuser follows Cosby playbook by pursuing defamation suit\n",
      "TEXT: NEW YORK (Reuters) - When former reality television contestant Summer Zervos accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct last fall, she pursued her claims solely in the court of public opinion, since the allegations dated too far back to allow a lawsuit. But last month, she found a fresh approach to fight the former host of “The Apprentice,” who has vehemently denied her allegations that he groped her in 2007. By professing his innocence, the man who is now president of the United States had effectively called her a liar, Servos alleges in a defamation lawsuit. The suit copied a rare legal tactic employed most notably by several women who have accused the actor and comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault: using his denials as the basis for a defamation claim. It is not uncommon for high-profile allegations against celebrities to prompt defamation lawsuits, but they are usually filed by the star against the accuser. In 2014, however, Joseph Cammarata, the attorney for Cosby accuser Tamara Green, realized he could adapt that strategy for his own purposes after Cosby’s lawyer issued a statement calling the allegations “fantastical.” Like many other Cosby accusers, Green was unable to sue for assault because the alleged incident occurred decades ago. “A direct claim for the assault is not available, so I came up with the idea that a defamation claim would be the appropriate vehicle to use to address the underlying harm,” said Cammarata, whose lawsuit now includes seven Cosby accusers as plaintiffs. All told, 10 Cosby accusers filed four defamation lawsuits in three states. In simple terms, the argument is that Trump and Cosby have effectively branded the women as liars by denying the incidents occurred. But the women face a difficult challenge in making their cases, experts say. “Merely saying, ‘I didn’t do it,’ is traditionally not seen in defamation law as calling your accuser a liar, even though logically that’s what it means,” said Rod Smolla, dean of the Delaware Law School and a First Amendment scholar.  “But if you go beyond that – if you go from, ‘I didn’t do it,’ to, ‘She’s a liar,’ now you have arguably made a statement of fact” that could be subject to liability, he added. Trump’s status as president does not shield him from civil liability for actions he took prior to assuming office. In a statement on Tuesday, the attorney defending Trump in the Zervos lawsuit, Marc Kasowitz, said he and Trump’s personal lawyer would soon file a response to the lawsuit. “President Trump continues to deny any allegation of wrongdoing raised in said complaint,” he said. Cosby, 79, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct from approximately 50 women, has also denied any wrongdoing. The Cosby and Trump plaintiffs are taking on a tough double burden, experts said. First, the only way to show the denials by both men are untrue is to prove the incidents took place as described. “The burden is going to be on her to show that Trump is actually saying something that’s false,” Clay Calvert, a First Amendment expert at the University of Florida, said of Zervos. In addition, the women must show Trump and Crosby crossed the line into defamation by deliberately making false statements that seriously harmed the accusers’ reputations. In defamation cases, courts typically examine statements to determine whether they were factual or opinion, as expressing an opinion is generally protected by the First Amendment. Making that distinction can be challenging. In the Cosby cases, for instance, judges have split on whether the lawsuits should proceed, even coming to opposite conclusions regarding the same statement from his attorney. U.S. District Judge Mark Mastroianni in Massachusetts rejected Cosby’s attempts to have two cases, including Green’s lawsuit, thrown out. In his rulings, the judge found that a November 2014 statement from Cosby’s lawyer calling the allegations “unsubstantiated, fantastical stories” could be reasonably seen as factual, and therefore potentially defamatory. By contrast, a Pittsburgh federal judge, Arthur Schwab, tossed a similar case against Cosby, finding that the same statement was “pure opinion” and thus protected. Unlike Cosby, who has been fairly circumspect in his public statements, Trump has aggressively attacked his accusers, calling the claims “100 percent fabricated and made-up.” His rhetoric could make him more vulnerable to a defamation claim, experts said. Trump has said he never met Zervos at a hotel, despite her allegation that he groped her at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California. That type of specific fact-based assertion can also make it easier to show defamation if it can be proven false, according to Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California in Los Angeles. “So much depends on the particular statement and the particular context surrounding that statement,” he said. \n",

      " TITLE: Now talk nice: EU script to help May settle Brexit bill\n",
      "TEXT: BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Diplomatic theatrics at last week s Brussels summit revealed how European Union leaders will coax British Prime Minister Theresa May over the next two months into parting with tens of billions of euros in return for a post-Brexit trade deal. May gave away nothing hardliners in her Conservative cabinet can beat her with. She stuck to earlier vague concessions about honoring commitments and insisting a  Brexit bill , which the EU reckons at around 60 billion euros ($70 billion), must be part of a package deal on what Britain s relationship with the EU will be once it leaves in March 2019. Sticking to their own script, the other 27 states gave May until the next regular summit in eight weeks to improve an offer officials estimate at about 20 billion euros if she wants them to start discussing future trade ties. Miss that deadline and, the EU says, time will be running out for any deal. Yet between the lines of well-rehearsed arguments that have hit  deadlock  in the view of the EU negotiator, the outlines of a political fix are emerging. It may create leeway to get round an impasse that is in neither side s interest and which has left businesses fearing the legal limbo of a messy divorce. In essence, the 27 need to trust May that Britain will pay much more than is on the table but understand her difficulties in naming a figure by December, which could spark revolt at home and derail the process. In return, they seem likely to let slip more hints of what kind of future relationship she might secure. The EU position is  solid , Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told reporters after the talks, but also  flexible . It was unrealistic, he said, to expect May to sell a precise demand for money in December. Equally, she could not expect the EU to negotiate a future trade deal without knowing roughly what outstanding items Britain would pay for. But defining those items could, Gentiloni said, be done  in the most politically manageable way possible for our British friends . Even the roughest of definitions will let commentators work out numbers. But as a senior diplomat from another major EU power put it:  We don t want to go public with a bald figure. If it s on the front page of The Sun, the whole process is dead.  Underlining a growing appreciation of May s limited room for maneuver, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was quoted in a German newspaper on Sunday as telling aides he found May  despondent  when they met last Monday, beset by party coup plots and asking Europeans to help her out.  Aware of her troubles, EU leaders accentuated the positive.  Reports of the deadlock ... have been exaggerated,  summit chair Donald Tusk concluded, adding that discussions with May had finally succeeded in  establishing trust and goodwill .  Tusk, a former Polish premier, echoed the EU mantra of unity among the 27 and full backing for European Commission negotiator Michel Barnier, whose team of technical experts are handling the talks with London. But he also acknowledged a nuance in his role in steering the high-level political imperatives of the leaders. That, Tusk said, meant he would be a  positive motivator  in the coming weeks to create  a more positive narrative  than what some British politicians call EU  blackmail  demands. Anxious not to worsen May s troubles at home, fellow leaders made an effort to demonstrate goodwill. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron take a hard line on  sequencing  divorce talks before trade, but they huddled with May in amicable conversation for television cameras. The EU communique acknowledged progress on key issues, which also comprise expatriate rights and the Irish border, and instructed Barnier to begin internal EU preparations for the talks May wants on a two-year transition period after Brexit. Tusk said EU preparations would  take account of proposals presented  by  our British friends    an indication that, even without direct talks, May might be able to show her domestic audience an outline of how the EU sees future ties. Over dinner on Thursday, she appealed for help and stressed two concessions made in a speech at Florence on Sept. 22   that the 27 would not lose out financially in the current EU budget ending in 2020 and that Britain would  honor its commitments . Some were disappointed that she repeated Britain s rejection of the legal basis of much of the EU s demands, notably that it pay for EU commitments lasting beyond 2020. Macron, for one, said they were  not even half way  toward an agreement on money. But others detected a more positive tone. Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said May had indicated that Britain was at least  analyzing  what other parts of the bill it might pay. Merkel said she had  no doubt  a good agreement was possible. Yet there are few illusions that the Brexit plot will play out smoothly.  We ve always predicted a drama for autumn,  one EU diplomat said.  We haven t seen it yet. So maybe November.  \n",

      " TITLE: From nursery to university: Emerging market investors buy into education\n",
      "TEXT: LONDON (Reuters) - Two decades after Yusuf Karodia launched Mancosa, a distance learning school to teach South Africans business skills, he sold up to UK private equity firm Actis. From nurseries to exam tutoring and adult education, teaching businesses are booming as populations rise and cash-strapped governments fail to keep up with demand.  With 263 million children out of school worldwide, according to 2014 data from the United Nations, investors are keen to access a growing sector with few publicly-listed companies.  Karodia said Actis was one of a stream of interested private investors.    We had about an overture a week to partner with someone,  he told Reuters. Mancosa is now part of Actis s expanding higher education portfolio in Africa. It has spent $275 million since 2014, investing in education institutes across the continent which it groups under the brand name Honoris Universities and plans to list on a stock market in the next two to three years. Karodia, who will also get a stake in Honoris, says there is huge demand for education in Africa.    Quality education - especially coming from the private sector - is going to play an ever increasingly important role,  he said.  The International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity estimates that international financing for education in low- and middle-income countries will need to increase from today s estimated $16 billion per year to $89 billion by 2030. Jetilde Carlos is a 22-year old final year finance student at the Varsity College in Cape Town, owned by Johannesburg-listed ADvTECH Group. Carlos missed out on a place at a state university.  Its not that my parents had the money but they really wanted a better life for me. They didn t want me to sit at home looking for job when I might not even find one,  she said.  The degree is worth it in the end        Investors are keen for a slice of the market because the fee-paying structure guarantees a regular income stream. The sector is also relatively resilient to economic ups and downs as parents increasingly prioritize their children s education.   It goes with the whole consumer spending (trend) in emerging markets, and as income levels rise and there is more disposable income available what you re seeing is the population is looking to spend in areas such as education,  said Patricia Ribeiro, an equity portfolio manager at American Century Investments. Carlos paid a deposit of 25,000 rand ($1,876.38). If you pay up front the total is 70,500 rand but the monthly payments that she has chosen bring the total to about 90,000 rand for one year s tuition.  The sector is dominated by private equity players. MSCI s emerging equity index contains only three education stocks - New York-listed Chinese firms TAL and New Oriental Education and Brazil s Kroton.  Morgan Stanley describes shares in Chinese education operators as  attractive . China s education market catering for children from nursery to end of secondary school will grow 8 percent annually to become a 3 trillion yuan ($460 billion) market in 2020, the bank told clients.  Recent regulatory changes are set to benefit private tutoring firms, many of which prepare high-school pupils for university. TAL said in July that student enrolment was up more than 60 percent year-on-year, with a matching rise in revenue. Its stock has soared 180 percent since January. New Oriental Education projects revenue growth of as much as 24 percent in the three months to end-August. Its shares are up 114 percent since the start of 2017.  China is very exam-driven from kindergarten on and they are competing more and more with U.S. schools,  said Sandra Ackermann-Schaufler, senior portfolio manager for emerging markets at SEI.  If anyone thinks it s tough to get into U.S. universities they should look at the top Chinese universities....the growth you could see is explosive growth.  Valuations are soaring, possibly because fund managers are chasing too few companies. TAL s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is nearly 130, while New Oriental Education hovers around 50. In contrast, MSCI s emerging equity index trades at a P/E of around 12.   If you look at PE historically or if you look at PE this year, they look very expensive,  Julian Mayo, portfolio manager at Charlemagne Capital. Brazil became another destination for those seeking exposure to education stocks after 2009 when the government boosted loan programs for students attending for-profit colleges.  One of the main beneficiaries was Brazil s largest for-profit college operator Kroton Educacional.  While the recent recession in Latin America s biggest economy led to a fall in student loans, the biggest companies are already well-established, fund managers said.  Results published last month showed revenue growing near double-digits on the quarter, with gross margins well above 70 percent. Kroton s stock has risen more than 50 percent since the start of the year. The Gulf region also offers opportunities. Kuwait-based HumanSoft, which establishes and manages private universities and colleges listed in 2005.   United Arab Emirates-based GEMS Education, which operates more than 250 schools across 14 countries and counts Blackstone among its stakeholders, has indicated plans to list. In Africa, many governments want more private investors in education but they are approaching it cautiously. They want regulations in place to ensure the quality is high. Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, Minister of International Affairs and Cooperation in Botswana said some young people had left private universities with certificates that  opened no doors . She said it was difficult to make sure  the people who are investing in education are not fraudsters, what we are finding is that some people are not there to deliver quality education.    We learned this very badly ourselves... but now people come in and invest, and this is taking a huge load off the government,  she said.  \n",

      " TITLE: In their best red stilettos, German transvestites stomp on AfD\n",
      "TEXT: BERLIN (Reuters) - German drag queens are using satire to spoof a hard-right party s anti-Islam election campaign, and German voters are loving it. They have formed Transvestites for Germany, or TfD, a name that bears an uncanny resemblance to Alternative for Germany (AfD), the name of Germany s leading right-wing party, and launched a Facebook campaign that has almost 7,000 followers. The AfD s election campaign focuses on messages that Islamic customs don t belong in Germany. That has left a bad taste with many Germans, and TfD saw an opportunity to use drag fashion and wit to mock the AfD s own election placards. The AfD posters feature white German women in bikinis or raising wine glasses, with captions like  Burka? I m into bikinis  and  Burka? I m into Burgundy . The posters are emblazoned with the party s election motto:  I dare you, Germany!  The TfD version of the posters uses the AfD s light blue party color but replaces the anti-immigrant party s red arrow with red stiletto shoes.  Guzzle your crap Burgundy alone! I prefer prosecco,  reads one poster with a picture of Gisela Sommer, one of several bearded men dressed like women and raising a middle finger on TfD placards, which include the hashtags #NoAfD and #NoNaziPack. JACKY-OH WEINHAUS The TfD campaign has drawn the attention of several German newspapers and has brought some flare to an otherwise largely dull election. Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to win and secure a fourth term in office without much trouble.  I don t think that all AfD members are Nazis, but there is an appalling racial tone in this party which is for sure shared by many of its members,  said TfD leader Jacky-Oh Weinhaus.  Buffalo Meus, the media manager of the fictional party, said he gets about 50 Facebook messages a day from people asking how they can become TfD members.  We just wanted an art project,  Meus said.  But some people have taken us for a real party. They ask us,  how can I register?  How can I vote for you?    Not all the messages are pleasant. Other readers have wished the group members death by stoning or by hanging. The group s main goal is get the 17 million Germans who stayed home in the 2013 election to the polls. They hope their votes will cut into support for the AfD, which is forecast to enter parliament for the first time with 8 to 10 percent of the vote.  Instead of supporting the AfD, the only party that criticizes Islam, you go against it,  an angry Facebook user called Hans Horn wrote to TfD this week.  If Islamisation continues and Muslim invaders from Africa continue to flood in you will be the first to be thrown from high roofs.  The TfD responded two days later:  We love you and wish you a sunny Wednesday!  \n",

      " TITLE: LPGA happy to let USGA make Trump course decision\n",
      "TEXT: INCHEON, South Korea (Reuters) - LPGA chief Mike Whan says the Tour will back golf authorities no matter what decision they make about hosting the 2017 US Women’s Open at a course owned by presidential nominee Donald Trump amid a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women. The United States Golf Association (USGA) is facing calls to move the event from Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey in nine months’ time after a 2005 video surfaced in which he bragged of kissing and groping women without consent. Whan told Reuters in an interview on Saturday at the LPGA/KLPGA co-sanctioned KEB Hana Bank Championship in Incheon that he was “lucky” not to have to make that kind of decision. The U.S. Women’s Open, the most prestigious tournament in ladies golf, is conducted by the USGA.  “In a strange way I’m lucky that the LPGA has no direct dealings with Donald Trump or Donald Trump properties,” he said. “Like any group we have people who are political in favor of different sides. I’m not here to be a politician, I know that what the players want is that I don’t get so political as to limit opportunities for women. “All I’ve said to the USGA is this, ‘You have long since proven you support women’s golf so if you tell us this is the right place to play then we’re right there with you.’” Whan took over in 2010 when the LPGA Tour was buckling from the fallout of the U.S. recession and his push for global growth has been a key factor in the circuit’s resurgence. One look at his business card tells you everything you need to know about his strategy for growing the women’s game — the word “commissioner” emblazoned in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. Whan said he hoped the global flavor of the Tour’s  schedule and sponsorship could help mitigate the effects of another downturn at home. “In the world of finance we have a pretty diverse portfolio,” he said of a tour which makes stops in China, Japan, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan in a late season Asian swing. More than a third of the circuit’s tournaments are sponsored by Asian firms or organizations. “It used to be that one U.S. economic downturn could really cripple the LPGA,” he added. “I’m not saying that wouldn’t happen tomorrow, but generally speaking we are pretty well diversified regionally.” Whan said now that the Tour had been put on a solid footing, with 33 official money events this year compared to 23 in 2011, the task was to boost the dollar value of tournaments rather than add new ones. “I think we need to be playing for $100 million in purse money,” he said of future targets. “I said that back in 2010 and people thought I was nuts, but that was when we were playing for $30 million. “Now we’re play for $65 million and I think we’ll get there.” The decision to add a fifth major to the annual tour schedule, the Evian Championship, was met with scorn by traditionalists and those outside the LPGA but Whan said it would be a mistake to be stuck in the past. “Sports that are unwilling to change because of history and tradition become historic and traditional,” he added. “If we just want golf to be historic and traditional and not move forward, then we would have a real problem.” \n",

      "TEXT: (Reuters) - The world is this generation s oyster.  China s  Class of 2012  is mostly ambitious and pragmatic. What do they want out of life?  For some, it's a husband. For others, an apartment in a city. Still others are happy with a stable job, or travel and new experiences.  Wang Siyue, a product specialist at an internet education company:   To be honest, how can I imagine what will happen in the next five years? You can make some plans but the world is unpredictable ... There s a very good saying: the luck of man is in balance. It s balanced. If you have good luck in the beginning, you ll have less luck later on. I believe in fate.   Hu Ruixin, a computer technician, talked about his dreams when he was in university:   I had a 15-year-plan for myself. For the first five years, I d open an advertising studio. In the next five years, I d let the studio develop into a company. With five more years, I d grow the company. But when I finally graduated from university and went into the world, I found this was hard to realize. There are too many restrictions and it s difficult, so I gave up.    The most important thing in life is responsibility. I ve got a child now and since becoming a parent feel that responsibility is really important.   Zhang Weixuan, an assistant secretary at a software company, who recently managed to get Beijing residency - a coveted  hukou :   My China Dream is simple. I hope to establish myself in a big city. Last year I got my Beijing  hukou , I successfully got it, and now I want to get married here and start my own family.    In my work field I hope to do well and in two years  time, or even now, buy a small apartment. Then I can establish myself. I think that d be pretty good.   Qi Jing, a township leader for the Communist Party Youth League, who grew up in Wuhan:   I think now my dilemma is when you reach a certain age you have less and less opportunities. Especially as a woman, your choices at work, your choices between work and family, you have to face them. Then you ll give up a lot of things. Maybe there s something you wanted to do when you were young and thought  why not give it a shot?  But what I feel now is I should slowly give them up, and focus on stability.   \n",

      " TITLE: Trump ‘travel ban bands’ take to stage in Texas capital\n",
      "TEXT: AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Bands with diaspora from the seven Muslim-majority countries on U.S. President Donald Trump’s original travel ban took to the stage in Austin to build resistance against executive orders critics see as perpetuating bigotry. For many musicians in the “ContraBanned” showcase that went from Friday night to early Saturday at the South by Southwest music festival, the show put a human face on the countries that have become a focal point of current U.S. politics. “I understand the travel ban was done with the impression for securing a place of safety for Americans. I feel it is short-sighted and perpetuates the xenophobia that exists in this country,” said Bassel Almadani, frontman and vocalist for the soul and funk band of Bassel & The Supernaturals. Almadani, raised in the U.S. Midwest from parents born in Syria, has relatives who have given up hope on leaving the country ripped apart by a civil war due to Trump’s proposed bans.  He has been trying to use his act to raise awareness about the six-year civil war that has set new standards of savagery in its impact on civilians, leaving an estimated half a million people dead. The Trump administration has said its executive orders are common sense approaches that will protect the American people. Attention from the bans has opened the door for Almadani to play in places like churches in Kansas where congregants want to learn more.  “For a good five years there, I thought I was pulling teeth to get that conversation moving,” Almadani said in an interview. “It wasn’t until the immigration ban went into place that people became more intent on the issue and more supportive of the cause.” Before the so-called “travel ban bands” took the stage in Texas, the U.S. government said it would appeal against a federal judge’s decision that struck down parts of the Trump travel ban on the day it was set to go into effect. The acts included people Kayem, a Libyan-American from Chicago and the sister group Faarrow, born in Mogadishu, Somalia and relocated to Canada from a refugee camp. London-based, Iranian born artist Ash Koosha would not attend after trouble securing a visa. South Sudanese-Canadian artist Emmanuel Jal said the showcase dubbed “music of the banned nations” could change hearts and minds. “The people who voted for Trump voted out of fear. Let us fight with love because love will win,” he said. \n",

      " TITLE: Too little cash, too much politics, leaves UNESCO fighting for life\n",
      "TEXT: PARIS (Reuters) - In the modernist but faded headquarters of UNESCO, the U.N. s cultural agency on Paris s elegant Left Bank, more than a few diplomats wandered the corridors on Friday wondering if the organization has a future. The agency, founded in the ashes of World War Two to protect the common cultural inheritance of humanity, was due to elect a new head later in the day. But a sudden announcement that the United States was quitting over anti-Israel bias meant that whoever wins the top job would inherit a body in turmoil, with huge questions over its future funding and mission.  I think it s a catastrophic decision,  said Daniel Rondeau, a former French envoy to the body.  It s a fracture that seriously jeopardizes the very nature of UNESCO - its universal dimension - and the very concept of multilateralism.  Officially known as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO is best known for designating and protecting archaeological and heritage sites, from the Galapagos Islands to the tombs of Timbuktu. Most of its activities are uncontroversial, but when it comes to, say, resolutions about how religious sites should be run in Jerusalem, every word is studied for accusations of bias. For some of its diplomats, Washington s decision to quit represented a corner being turned, and puts even more pressure on whoever is elected to lead it.  This is the most critical election. There can t be four more years like this,  said a Western diplomat, bemoaning the leadership of outgoing director Irina Bokova of Bulgaria, whose critics say she failed to persuade member states to pay their dues and stop politicizing UNESCO s work. At the heart of its recent problems is a financing crisis since 2011, when UNESCO voted to admit Palestine as a full member state and Washington responded by halting payment of its annual $80 million in dues. The United States and Israel were among just 14 of 194 members to vote against Palestine s membership. Washington says it favors an independent Palestinian state some day, but it must arise from negotiations, and admitting the Palestinians to international bodies beforehand hurts the peace process. Since then, Israel has regularly complained over resolutions about cultural sites in the West Bank and Jerusalem, arguing that they are worded to delegitimize the Jewish state. Israel s foes say it uses U.S. support to deflect bona fide criticism. Without U.S. money, UNESCO, which employs around 2,000 people worldwide, has been forced to cut programs, freeze hiring and fill gaps with voluntary contributions. Its 2017 budget was about $326 million, almost half its 2012 budget.  We need to do less with less. We ve spent too long trying to do too much without the means,  said a UNESCO official, who declined to be identified.  We need to sell ourselves better, but without funding it s difficult to change our image.   Including the United States, which has some $542 million in arrears, the organization is owed almost $650 million, according to figures on its website. At this stage, UNESCO officials still don t know if the United States will make up its arrears before it officially exits on Dec. 31, 2018.  Other major contributors such as Japan, Britain, and Brazil have also yet to pay their dues for 2017, sometimes citing objections to the body s policies.  The fact is that UNESCO was all about solidarity and creating a climate for peace between countries, but nations now use their dues to influence programs,  said a UNESCO-based diplomat.  That needs to change.  Japan, for example, has threatened to withhold dues over the inclusion of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in the body s  Memory of the World  program. Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over Crimea, with Kiev accusing Moscow of trying to legitimize its annexation of the territory through UNESCO.  Whoever takes over at the helm has to tackle this head on. They need to find ways of getting nations to talk these issues through, but if they can t, then the director-general needs to be able to say  no  and kill these texts,  said a second UNESCO-based diplomat. Unlike at the U.N. Security Council, where five powers wield a veto, UNESCO takes decisions based on majority votes, either of its General Secretariat that includes all 195 nations, or of the 58-member Executive Board. Israel says this creates a built-in majority for states that are hostile to it. Big countries like the United States that provide most of the funding say their single votes give them little input into how their money is spent. Prior to Thursday s U.S. decision to withdraw, UNESCO s board had tried to evade confrontation by voting to postpone divisive Israeli-Palestinian texts until April, diplomats said. All the candidates running to head UNESCO have vowed grassroots reforms and efforts to de-politicize the institution. The final candidates are two former culture ministers from France and Qatar. But even the vote on a new boss is tinged with politics, since Egypt, which has also vied for the top post, and Qatar are on opposite sides in a diplomatic dispute in the Arab world. \n",

      " TITLE: U.S. lawmakers seek missing information in review of Monsanto weedkiller\n",
      "TEXT: LONDON, (Reuters) - The chairman of a congressional committee has asked the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) to explain why its National Cancer Institute (NCI) failed to publish data that showed no links between glyphosate and cancer. In a Tuesday letter seen by Reuters, U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy, who chairs the House Committee on Government and Oversight Reform (OGR), said he “is concerned about the new revelations” and is “seeking more information” about why the exculpatory results were not published by the NCI. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in Monsanto’s top-selling weedkiller Roundup. Gowdy’s letter to NIH Director Francis Collins follows a June report by Reuters which found that a senior scientist from the NCI knew that fresh data from a large research project known as the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) showed no links between glyphosate and cancer.  Draft scientific papers dating from 2013 containing the data were never published. Consequently, the information was not able to be taken into account during the March 2015 review of the pesticide by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). An NIH spokeswoman told Reuters the NIH had received Gowdy’s letter “and will be responding directly to the committee.” Aaron Blair, the senior scientist at the NCI who knew about the data and also chaired the IARC review, previously told Reuters the data was not published in time because there was too much to fit into one scientific paper. Blair is now retired from the NCI. An NCI spokeswoman told Reuters in June the institute was drafting a manuscript on this topic. It would “explore the effects of glyphosate exposure in greater depth”, she said, and would be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal “in the coming months.”     Gowdy’s letter asked for “a briefing on these issues as soon as possible”. It also asked for information and any documents relating to the unpublished AHS data on glyphosate.     No one at IARC, which is based in Lyon, France, was immediately available for comment late on Tuesday.     IARC concluded in 2015 that glyphosate, is a “probable human carcinogen.” It based its finding on “limited evidence” of carcinogenicity in humans and “sufficient evidence” in experimental animals.      The agency’s assessment is at odds with other international regulators who have said the weedkiller is not a carcinogenic risk to humans.      The OGR has been looking into U.S. taxpayer funding of IARC. It began investigating IARC’s operations in 2016 after several lawmakers raised questions about why U.S. taxpayers were funding an agency that often faces criticism for its work.  A letter by Jason Chaffetz, then chairman of the OGR, in September 2016, also addressed to the NIH director, described IARC as having “a record of controversy, retractions, and inconsistencies” and asked why the NIH continued to fund it.      In previous responses to questions about its assessments of glyphosate and many other substances, IARC has defended them as scientifically sound.  The agency says its “monographs” - the name it gives its classifications of carcinogens - are “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and ... freedom from conflicts of interest”. \n",

      " TITLE: Woman who accused Bill Clinton of assault to campaign against Hillary presidential run\n",
      "TEXT: NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the women who has accused former U.S. President Bill Clinton of sexual assault says she has agreed to work for an anti-Clinton political group being formed by a former advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer who says Bill Clinton groped her in an Oval Office hallway in 1993 when she came to him tearfully seeking a paid job, said she had agreed to become a paid national spokeswoman for a group being created by Roger Stone. Stone, a Republican strategist, said the group would become active should Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton’s wife, win the Democratic nomination in the 2016 race for the White House. Clinton is currently the front runner.  “This gives me more of an opportunity to get this message out to young voters who weren’t even born or don’t even remember what happened and to the women who have suffered,” Willey told Reuters. Willey said she will give interviews and speeches and appear in political advertisements to ensure the accusations remain part of the political discourse during the election campaign.  “They’re going to be confronted every day, on radio, on television, on billboards,” Stone told Reuters, referring to the Clintons. He said he had reached a verbal agreement with Willey  but cautioned that the group was still in the planning stages.  Spokesmen for Hillary and Bill Clinton did not respond to questions about Willey. Stone’s political action committee, which can raise virtually unlimited funds to advocate for or against candidates, was originally created last year under the name Women Against Hillary. It was renamed in January as the Rape Accountability Project for Education PAC, or RAPE PAC.  In a 1998 deposition, Clinton “emphatically” denied Willey’s accusation he groped her, describing her as having “been through a lot” in reference to her family’s financial woes and her husband’s suicide on the day Willey says her encounter with Clinton happened. Clinton has admitted having extra-marital affairs with two other women: Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and Gennifer Flowers, a singer and actor from his home state of Arkansas, but he and his lawyers have said accusations by other women are false. It’s not clear whether Stone’s group will resonate with voters. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in January found that a majority of the public, including 68 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans, thought that Bill Clinton’s past sexual misconduct “made no difference” in the current race.   Among women, 56 percent said it did not matter, while another 21 percent said it would hurt Hillary Clinton’s chances of winning the election. Several Republican candidates, particularly Trump, have reminded voters of the allegations while campaigning. The Clintons and their staff have dismissed this as dirty politics. Hillary Clinton’s decision to advocate for victims of sexual assault has persuaded some of her husband’s other accusers, including Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones McFadden, to wade into the political season. Broaddrick and Willey say that Clinton, who has said victims of sexual assault have the “right to be believed,” is being hypocritical by doubting her husband’s accusers. When asked about the accusations by Broaddrick, Jones McFadden and Willey at a campaign event in New Hampshire in December, Hillary Clinton replied that people who say they were sexually assaulted should be “believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.”  Stone released a book last year called “The Clintons’ War on Women,” for which Willey wrote the foreword. After leaving Trump’s campaign, Stone created a pro-Trump political action committee, the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness. He says he remains friendly with Trump. Trump himself, angered at Hillary Clinton calling him sexist, described Bill Clinton as “one of the great women abusers of all time” and Hillary Clinton his “enabler” at a campaign event last month. A spokeswoman for Trump, who is barred by Federal Election Commission rules from coordinating with super PACs, did not respond to questions. Stone has also helped to set up an online fundraising page to help raise money to pay for Willey’s mortgage, he said. She said she has been in financial difficult since her husband’s suicide and is facing foreclosure on her Virginia home this month.

      " TITLE: Thousands of voters in limbo after Kansas demands proof they're American\n",
      "TEXT: WICHITA, Kansas (Reuters) - After moving to Kansas, Tad Stricker visited a state motor vehicle office to perform what he thought was the routine task of getting a new driver’s license and registering to vote. It was a familiar procedure for Stricker, 37, who has moved from state to state frequently in his work as a hotel manager. He filled out a voter registration form and got his driver’s license. He was not asked for more documents, he said. So he was stunned when he tried to cast a ballot in November 2014 and was told he was not on the voter rolls. A month later, a letter from the state said why: His registration had been placed “in suspense” because he had failed to meet a state requirement he did not know about - proving he was an American. Spurred by Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a national leader in pushing for anti-immigration and voting changes, more than 36,000 Kansas residents have joined Stricker in limbo since early 2013 under a state law that raises a new and higher barrier to voting in the United States: proof of citizenship. While you must be a U.S. citizen to vote in American elections, most states allow those wishing to register to simply sign a statement affirming they are citizens and provide a driver’s license number, Social Security number, or other proof of residency.  A Reuters analysis of the Kansas suspense list shows the law disproportionately hits young voters, who often do not have ready access to the needed documents, as well as unaffiliated and Democratic voters in the Republican-controlled state. “What a shock,” said Stricker, who was born in Missouri and moved to Kansas with his wife from Illinois. “I was under the impression I had registered to vote, I had done everything I needed to. I just thought, ‘This can’t be happening.’” While the law won’t affect its status as a safe Republican state in November’s presidential election, it thrusts Kansas into a national debate over voting restrictions that has accelerated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. Kobach’s involvement has raised the stakes in the fight against the Kansas law. Democrats and voting rights advocates say his influence with conservatives could help spread the concept to other states. His critics scored a victory on May 17 when a federal judge weakened the law. Kobach quickly appealed. The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, and Stricker was a plaintiff in the case. Photo identification laws and other voting measures have proliferated in recent years in Republican-held states, but “the one that gets me most nervous” is the proof of citizenship requirement in Kansas, said Pratt Wiley, director of voter expansion for the Democratic National Committee. “What you will see is that what is learned in one state, or doesn’t work in one state, there is a small adjustment and then it’s applied in a different state,” Wiley said, calling Kansas “patient zero” in that process. Kobach has gained a national reputation for pushing a series of voting and anti-immigration measures across the country, leading one Democratic congressman to dub him “the dark lord” of the anti-immigration movement - a label he wears proudly. “I don’t know if I would call it a badge of honor but it reflects that I’m moving the ball in what I think is the right direction,” Kobach said in an interview in his Topeka office across from the state Capitol. Three other states have adopted proof of citizenship laws championed by Kobach, although officials said two of them had not implemented them. Bills have been introduced in at least nine other states to create a similar law since 2012, although none have advanced very far, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The law Kobach spearheaded in Kansas requires registrants to prove their citizenship by providing one of a series of documents, including birth certificates and passports. They are placed on the suspense list if they can’t. Since late last year, those who did not complete the requirements for registration have been purged from the voter rolls after 90 days and had to begin the process over again. About 14 percent of Kansans who tried to register between the law’s onset in 2013 and late 2015 failed to meet the requirement and went on the suspense list, according to documents filed in a lawsuit challenging the requirement. “It’s created a system that is needlessly complex and very discouraging, particularly for young people,” said Steve Lopes, head of the Johnson County Voting Coalition, which helps register voters. “Now people just say, ‘Forget it, I’m not going to vote’.” Kobach rejects accusations the law is designed to suppress voter turnout, particularly among minority and low-income voters who tend to back Democrats. He says it is aimed at stopping what he describes as a rampant problem of non-citizens voting in U.S. elections - even though there is little evidence of the problem. “Every time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen. That’s real disenfranchisement, it’s happening every election and it’s happening in every state,” Kobach said, estimating thousands of non-citizens are on voting rolls in big states with large immigrant populations. Citing that threat, Kobach convinced the Kansas legislature in 2015 to give him the power to prosecute voter fraud. But he has won just four misdemeanor illegal voting convictions, mostly involving people who owned at least two properties and cast votes in both locations. None involved non-citizens voting, although Kobach said more complaints will be filed. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson, who issued a May 17 order that Kansas begin to register more than 18,000 voters kept off the rolls by the proof of citizenship law, noted Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and the onset of the law in 2013. “The court cannot find that the state’s interest in preventing non-citizens from voting in Kansas outweighs the risk of disenfranchising thousands of qualified voters,” she wrote. Of the 16,775 people on a late-April suspense list obtained by Reuters, more than half were ages 17 through 21, and more than 60 percent were age 25 or under. They were clustered in the high-population areas of Wichita, Topeka and the Kansas City suburbs, and the college towns of Lawrence and Manhattan. About 41 percent were unaffiliated, more than the approximately 30 percent of registered Kansas voters who are unaffiliated. About 35 percent of those on the list were Democrats, compared to 24 percent of registered voters. Twenty-three percent were Republicans, compared to 45 percent of registered voters, according to a Reuters analysis of the data. Younger voters, who are more likely to register as unaffiliated or Democrats, have a harder time getting the documents needed and have less patience with what has become an unwieldy process, said Michael Smith, a professor at Emporia State University who has studied the Kansas suspense list. Kobach said it was “natural” that young people were heavily represented on the suspense list because they are the majority of new registrants. He rejected criticism that a proof of citizenship requirement created a higher barrier for registrants. “If you define a barrier to voting as just having to do something before you vote, every state has that barrier, virtually every state requires proof of address,” he said.  In her court ruling, Robinson said the Kansas requirement conflicted with a federal law designed to make it easier to register while getting a driver’s license. She ordered Kansas on June 14 to begin registering Stricker and other residents who had submitted voter applications through state motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of citizenship. They will be able to vote in federal elections for the presidency and U.S. Congress.   But Robinson’s ruling did not end the proof of citizenship requirement for Kansans who register by mail or at locations other than motor vehicle offices, and it left even those registering while getting a driver’s license ineligible to vote for state and local offices. For now, that has created a chaotic two-tier system where some Kansans can vote in state elections and some cannot, some need to provide proof of citizenship and others do not, and many county election officials are uncertain how to proceed. “It’s a complete mess,” said Marge Ahrens, co-president of the nonpartisan Kansas League of Women Voters.  \n",

      " TITLE: Trump campaign paid lawyer now representing son $50,000 in June\n",
      "TEXT: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s campaign paid $50,000 to the law office now representing Donald Trump Jr. a little more than a week before news surfaced of an unreported meeting with a Russian attorney that has prompted new accusations of collusion. The payment to the Law Offices of Alan S. Futerfas, dated June 27, was disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday. It was described as covering “legal consulting” fees.  Trump Jr. admitted to meeting with a Russian lawyer in New York City during the 2016 presidential campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about his father’s rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The payment was made to Futerfas’ firm days before the story about the meeting broke, which caused a scramble inside the White House and Trump Tower to contain it.  The disclosures do not say who Futerfas was hired to represent. Spokesmen for Trump’s re-election campaign and Futerfas did not respond to requests for comment.  Futerfas was revealed as Trump Jr.’s lawyer on Monday after a New York Times report detailed meetings between the president’s eldest son and the Russian lawyer. Futerfas has not said when he was hired.      Separately, the campaign also paid more than $538,000 to Jones Day, the law firm that represented Trump’s campaign during the election. The campaign also paid $89,561 for “legal consulting” to The Trump Corporation, which is owned by the president. The payment was dated June 30th. A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as potential connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and the president and Trump Jr. have denied any collusion. The Federal Election Commission has previously ruled that candidates and federal office holders may spend campaign funds on legal fees incurred because they were a candidate. Trump has also hired a longtime legal adviser, Marc Kasowitz, as outside counsel. His campaign finance disclosure did not list any payments to Kasowitz. The White House confirmed in a statement on Saturday that veteran Washington attorney Ty Cobb will serve as special counsel, and sources familiar with the hiring said Cobb would handle the White House’s response to the Russia-related investigations. Cobb, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, is expected to be an intermediary between the White House and Congress, as well as outside attorneys as the probes continue.  In the second quarter of 2017, Trump’s re-election campaign raised about $8 million and spent $4.4 million, according to Saturday’s disclosures. Much of the money raised from individuals came in the form of “small dollar” donations, classed as donations of less than $250. Trump and his campaign have frequently touted the number of small-dollar donors as proof of his widespread support. Trump filed for re-election the day after taking office - allowing his campaign to continue to raise and spend money while he is in office. \n",

      " TITLE: Hillary Clinton for NYC mayor? Probably not, but rumors persist\n",
      "TEXT: NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the weeks since Hillary Clinton’s shock election defeat to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, a rumor has taken hold among New York City’s political chattering class: could she challenge Mayor Bill de Blasio’s reelection bid this year? Discussion of a possible Clinton campaign intensified last week when conservative news website Newsmax reported that Democrats unhappy with de Blasio were pressing her to run. Stories soon appeared in various outlets, including the New York Times and the New York Daily News. Still, the chances seem remote. Although the mayor of the largest U.S. city is often seen as a national figure, it could be seen as a step down for Clinton, 69, a former U.S. secretary of state who came tantalizingly close to winning the White House two months ago. “I’m a Brooklyn kid, and my comment is, fuhgeddaboudit,” said Douglas Muzzio, a political scientist at Baruch College in New York and an expert in city politics. “There is zero chance that’s going to happen.” Clinton has yet to say what she plans to do next, and representatives of Clinton’s presidential campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. A Clinton confidante, Neera Tanden, said on CNN on Sunday that Clinton was focused on helping children and families in her next role. “I don’t expect her to ever run for any elective office again,” Tanden said when asked if Clinton would run for mayor. De Blasio, a fellow Democrat who won his first term in 2013, has had some rocky moments, including state and federal corruption investigations that have reportedly examined his fundraising tactics. A high-profile figure in the party’s liberal wing, De Blasio supported Clinton in the presidential primary after some public waffling. A spokesman for his reelection campaign declined to comment on a potential Clinton candidacy. In the presidential election, Clinton won more than 80 percent of the votes in heavily Democratic New York City, despite Trump’s status as a native son born in the borough of Queens. Clinton first moved to New York State in 1999 in order to run for the U.S. Senate, winning election the following year. She lives with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in Chappaqua, New York, about 30 miles (48 km) north of the city. Under state law, Clinton could run for mayor as long as she became a city resident by the election, according to the Times. \n",

      " TITLE: Trump son-in-law Kushner's congressional statement\n",
      "TEXT: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - I am voluntarily providing this statement, submitting documents, and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the Trump for President Campaign and during the transition period. I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception. Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. My Role in the Trump for President Campaign Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-law’s campaign when he decided to run for President. However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility.  Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials. All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaign’s ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not. It is also important to note that a campaign’s success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people. Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons  When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail. To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange. With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in  Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump’s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America’s foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions. Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador. When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, “What is the name of the Russian ambassador?” Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred. The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m. The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the other’s meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as “Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner.” No one else was mentioned. I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote “Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.” I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form. There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname “Guccifer400.” This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump’s tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all traveling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply — which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again. To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.  Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited. On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassador’s name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks — on December 1. The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the President’s National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day. The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his “generals.” He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a “secret back channel.” I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions. Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12. My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13. The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts — one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since.  To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government. Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it. In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017. That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had “numerous contacts with foreign officials” and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form. It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Israel’s Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before. Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be “update(d), clarif(ied), and explain(ed)” as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting. For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the meeting. As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia. I have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved. It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest. \n",

      " TITLE: With military discipline imposed, Trump getting more time for decisions\n",
      "TEXT: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s choice of a general as chief of staff has quickly brought more order to the White House and is giving the president more time to ponder decisions as he tries to bounce back from a rocky six months with no major legislative achievements. But John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general with an intimidating air, still has many challenges to confront to stem the chaos that has raged at the White House since Trump took office in January, not least the Republican president’s free-wheeling style.  Trump, who attended a military prep school growing up, is said to be pleased at the increased discipline that Kelly has brought in since taking over from Reince Priebus, who struggled to maintain order and was often ignored by senior staff. “He is feeling like he’s getting more time to read the materials and have substantive discussions and talk about the decisions he’s making,” said a White House official, who asked not to be identified. “Before, he was carrying a lot himself. It feels now like there is more burden-sharing around. He has more trust and confidence in Kelly,” the official said. Aides said Kelly, who previously was running the Department of Homeland Security and who began work on Monday, was commanding respect in the West Wing. “Kelly is scary in a way that Reince wasn’t,” said an administration official. Senior staff meetings are well attended and no longer considered optional as they were under Priebus. Typically anyone who goes into the Oval Office to see Trump makes sure Kelly knows. “I think you’ve seen less backbiting,” said Ken Duberstein, who was a chief of staff for 1980s President Ronald Reagan. “I think the idea that he is asserting, that the White House cannot be a free-wheeling place but rather there is a chain of command and things go in an orderly process, are all major steps in the right direction.” So far, Kelly has not managed to put a stop to leaks to the media that have infuriated Trump.  On Thursday, the Washington Post published transcripts of Trump’s sometimes fraught calls in the early days of his presidency with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. He has not reined in the president himself, and it is by no means clear he will try to do so. Confidants say Trump is still speed-dialing people in the evenings, as he has done for decades. He is still firing off bombastic tweets, like one on Thursday blaming the Republican-controlled Congress for what he called an all-time low in relations with Russia because it piled on more sanctions. But Trump did stay on message at a rally in West Virginia on Thursday night, reading from a Teleprompter and sticking to the script. Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, said time will tell whether Kelly can reform any of the habits Trump has displayed during the first six months in office.”He’ll have some of the smartest people around him and they’re not there to change him but to make him better. Even Tom Brady needs a coach,” said Bennett, referring to the highly successful New England Patriots quarterback. Trump’s friends said there is value to letting Trump be Trump, particularly since Priebus’ attempt to shape Trump into a more traditional president failed spectacularly. “Kelly can go too far in the other direction. Donald Trump doesn’t need a babysitter. He’s his own man,” said one friend. “I understand the attitude of the military types that if they can control all information flow they can control the president. But the first time he learns something that he should have heard from staff, there will be hell to pay.” Trump has yet to notch up a major legislative win and Kelly has scant experience with lawmakers. In the mid-1990s he served as the Marine Corps commandant’s liaison officer to the U.S. House of Representatives. So far his appointment is being welcomed on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers had grown weary of the chaos at the White House. Many were heartened to see one of Kelly’s first acts was to jettison Anthony Scaramucci as communications director after a foul-mouthed tirade against Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon. “He is going to bring such an air of calm,” said Senator David Perdue, a Republican and early supporter of Trump’s election campaign. “This man has been through a career of providing results, and showing leadership.” Kelly is seen as likely to form a partnership with two other retired generals in Trump’s inner circle, Defense Secretary James Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster. The three attended a meeting of top national security aides on Thursday in the White House Situation Room aimed at settling on a strategy for Afghanistan that Trump, who tends to be non-interventionist, will find acceptable. Whether they will be able to overcome his doubts about sending around 4,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan is unclear. “I think he likes the snap and efficiency. But I seriously question whether any of them share his non-interventionist world view,” the friend said. \n",

      " TITLE: Far right makes most noise on Twitter in German election\n",
      "TEXT: FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The far right is making the most noise on Twitter during Germany s election campaign, but far less fake news is being spread in Germany than the United States saw before the election that put Donald Trump in power, an Oxford University study has found. Of the million tweets tracked in the study, 30 percent were tied to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD). The party is polling around 10 percent, putting it on track to enter parliament for the first time after the Sept. 24 election. But more broadly, German users of Twitter showed a greater aversion to  junk  news than their counterparts in the United States before the November presidential election or in Britain before its general election in June. And Twitter itself is used far less by Germans than by Americans and Britons. Junk news as defined by the researchers includes various forms of propaganda and hyper-partisan or conspiratorial political news, but also more modest community activist content, political satire and links to non-German language content. Nor have government officials and security experts seen signs of the kind of hacking and suspicious news leaks suspected of playing a role in the U.S. and French presidential elections. In any case, the sharing of false or misleading headlines and mass posting by automated  bots  appears to have had little influence in a placid German campaign, the report s authors said. Polls predict Angela Merkel will easily win her fourth term as chancellor.  The impact of political bots was minor overall, with highly automated accounts generating a small fraction of the Twitter traffic about the election,  wrote authors Lisa-Maria Neudert, Bence Kollanyi and Philip Howard of the Project on Computational Propaganda. Most of the bots were working in the service of the AfD, they added. The survey was taken from around 150,000 Twitter accounts in the first 10 days of September, using hashtags associated with Germany s main political parties, leading candidates and the election itself. Hashtags are used to flag and search for themes on Twitter, which tracks popular trending topics. The data showed German Twitter users were four times more likely to post links to stories from recognized, professional news organizations than to junk news - a higher ratio than in the United States and Britain, but lower than in France. Merkel warned last November of the potential influence of social bots and digital misinformation on public opinion, and mainstream political parties pledged to refrain from using them in campaigning. Her own Christian Democrats, polling around 36 percent, only accounted for 18 percent of political chatter on Twitter. The Social Democrats, polling in second on around 22 percent, accounted for 9 percent of election-related tweets. German lawmakers have passed tough legislation that imposes fines of up to 50 million euros ($60 million) on companies operating social media platforms if they fail to take down defamatory and fake news promptly. The tough penalties reflect concern about political propaganda and manipulation dating back to Germany s history of totalitarian rule - both fascist and communist - during the 20th century.  The 2017 German elections have produced one of the lowest levels of automated content on Twitter as compared to all the democracies we have studied,  the researchers wrote. The group has conducted similar studies over the past year in Britain, France and the United States. \n",

      " TITLE: Should I stay or should I go? U.S. civil servants gird for Trump\n",
      "TEXT: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election has set off a round of resume-polishing across Washington, as the nation’s federal civil servants prepare for a leader who has promised to freeze hiring and reverse many of the policies they have spent the past eight years putting in place.  While anti-Washington rhetoric is a staple of U.S. politics, more than two dozen federal workers interviewed by Reuters said Trump’s divisive presidential campaign pointed to bigger potential problems than those that would normally come with a routine switch from a Democratic to a Republican administration.     The New York businessman’s lack of political experience and contentious rhetoric have prompted some to assess whether they should leave government before he takes office on Jan. 20.     As the Republican presidential candidate, Trump encouraged his supporters to harass journalists and attack protesters. He vowed to sue news outlets and women who accused him of sexual assault and said he would jail his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump’s conduct has caused some undercover agents to worry that their identities could be made public if they step out of line, said Susan Hennessey, a former attorney at the National Security Agency who has been urging people in government to keep working in Trump’s administration to help resist potential abuses of power. “I can’t and don’t blame anyone who feels they can’t stay,” she said. Other federal workers worry their integrity could be compromised if they work on cases that affect Trump’s vast business interests. Trump’s taxes are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service and the National Labor Relations Board is involved in a labor dispute at his Las Vegas hotel. Changes to tax laws or pollution rules could potentially impact some of his property holdings. “Do I get out or is it all the more important that I stay in to push back on the problematic things?” said one federal worker, who, like others interviewed for this story, asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation at work. A transfer of power always convulses Washington to some degree, particularly when it comes to the departure and arrival of political appointees in more than 4,000 posts. Those top officials oversee 2.7 million civilian workers, from park rangers to tax lawyers, who are expected to enact the president’s agenda and enforce laws passed by Congress regardless of their personal political views. But several workers told Reuters they’d rather leave government service than carry out orders they don’t agree with, pointing specifically at Trump’s vow to undo President Barack Obama’s policies on trade, immigration, health care and environmental protection.  National security officials have printed out their resignation letters, ready to hand them in if Trump tries to revive policies such as waterboarding or mass surveillance of Americans they oppose on legal or moral grounds, according to  more than 20 military, intelligence and Foreign Service officers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity. Regulators at the Environmental Protection Agency privately say they are looking for new jobs ahead of expected cutbacks at their agency, whose climate-change rules were criticized by Trump on the campaign trail.  One manager is urging employees to stay on the job. “Sometimes democracy surprises you.  And while the election results will no doubt bring many changes over the coming months, our job remains the same,” Sarah Dunham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Atmospheric Programs, wrote to colleagues two days after the election. Misgivings apparently extend into the nation’s 1.5 million military service members as well. A survey released by the Military Times on Friday found that one in five service members said they will not re-enlist with Trump as Commander-in-chief. During his campaign, Trump promised to rescind two regulations for every new one his administration issues and freeze hiring at agencies that don’t cover public safety, public health or national defense. Republicans in Congress have pushed to erode job protections and scale back benefits. That would be a further blow for federal workers who have weathered furloughs, salary freezes and a three-week government shutdown in recent years. The civilian work force has shrunk by 4 percent since Obama’s first year in office, according to White House figures, and it could shrink further. More than one-third of federal workers will be eligible for retirement next year, according to a 2014 Government Accountability Office report. “This isn’t the worst thing that’s happened to us,” said a scientist who manages a fisheries laboratory in the Pacific Northwest of the expected changes. “It’s kind of continual.” There may be a silver lining for those who are trying to get a job working for Uncle Sam. Trump has promised to increase the number of border-security agents and immigration-enforcement officers as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration. And several managers said they were rushing to fill vacancies on their teams before Trump’s promised hiring ban takes effect.  “Everybody seems to be scrambling to fill the positions they have open now,” one said. \n",

      " TITLE: Use it or lose it: Occasional Ohio voters may be shut out in November\n",
      "TEXT: CINCINNATI (Reuters) - When Larry Harmon tried to vote on a marijuana initiative in November in his hometown of Kent, Ohio, the 59-year-old software engineer found his name had been struck from the voter rolls. Two hours south in Zanesville, restaurant worker Chris Conrad, 37, was also told he was no longer registered. Both men later found out why: they had not voted often enough. As the Nov. 8 elections loom, officials in Ohio have removed tens of thousands of voters from registration lists because they have not cast a ballot since 2008.  All U.S. states periodically cleanse their voter rolls, but only a handful remove voters simply because they don’t vote on a regular basis. And nowhere could the practice have a greater potential impact in the state-by-state battle for the White House than Ohio, a swing state that has backed the winner in every presidential election since 1960. Voters of all stripes in Ohio are affected, but the policy appears to be helping Republicans in the state’s largest metropolitan areas, according to a Reuters survey of voter lists. In the state’s three largest counties that include Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, voters have been struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods. That’s because residents of relatively affluent Republican-leaning neighborhoods are more likely to vote in both congressional elections and presidential contests, historical turnouts show. Democrats are less likely to vote in mid-term elections and thus are more at risk of falling off the rolls.  In the three biggest counties, at least 144,000 voters have been removed, the Reuters analysis found. The statewide total is unclear. Each of the state’s 88 counties manages its own voter rolls, which generally are not made public.  Unlike other voting-rights disputes that have sparked protests and lawsuits, the practice doesn’t appear to be driven by one specific party. Both Republican and Democratic officials in Ohio have purged inactive voters over the past 20 years. But neighborhoods that have a high proportion of poor, African-American residents are hit hardest, the Reuters analysis found. “It’s absolutely unfair,” said Donna Porter-Jones, an organizer at Amos Project, an interfaith group that aims to register 30,000 voters from some of Cincinnati’s poorest neighborhoods ahead of November.  Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, says canceling registrations for voters who missed three straight federal elections helps keep voting rolls current. Since 2011, the state has cleared out more than 2 million records of people who have moved or died, he said.  Those who don’t vote over a six-year stretch or respond to a postcard mailed to their address have only themselves to blame, he said. “If this is really important thing to you in your life, voting, you probably would have done so within a six-year period,” he said in an interview. People who don’t respond to the postcard can be removed from voting lists if they sit out the next two federal elections. Many other states only remove voters from the rolls if they have died or moved to a new address. “You shouldn’t be struck of your right to vote because you skipped an election,” said Kathleen Clyde, a Democratic state representative who has been fighting the practice. Four civil liberties groups sued to end the practice last month, arguing that it violates federal law and unfairly targets low-income and minority voters.   Voting-rights advocates say they are concerned that many infrequent voters who helped drive turnout to a record in the 2008 presidential election won’t be able to vote in this year’s likely matchup between Democrat Hillary Clinton, vying to become the first female president, and Republican Donald Trump, the celebrity billionaire. The Ohio lawsuit is one of a number being fought across the country. Photo ID requirements and other efforts to tighten voting laws have spurred fierce partisan battles and protests in recent months. They follow a Supreme Court decision in 2013 that struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, a signature achievement of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. The Ohio dispute, by contrast, centers on a practice that has been in place for decades but is receiving new attention from civil liberties groups and Democrats ahead of November.  “We are pleased the courts are reviewing the state’s actions,” said Pratt Wiley, national director of voter expansion at the Democratic Party in Washington. Republican party officials at the local and national level, as well as the Trump campaign, did not respond to requests for comment. But Tom Fitton, the head of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has pushed Ohio and other states to keep their voting lists up to date, described the lawsuit as a “power play” by civil liberties groups “to ensure that candidates they like are able to steal elections if necessary.”  Federal law prohibits states from removing voters solely because they haven’t voted, but it also requires them to keep voter lists up to date. Ohio residents who are removed from voting lists must re-register at least 30 days before an election.  Harmon, the software engineer, backed President Barack Obama in 2008 but has sat out presidential and congressional elections since then. He says he initially thought he had done something wrong to get kicked off the voting rolls. “I felt embarrassed and stupid at the time,” said Harmon, who is involved in the Ohio lawsuit. “The more I think about it, the madder I am,” he said. In Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County, 5 percent of voters in neighborhoods that backed Obama by more than 60 percent in 2012 were purged last year due to inactivity, according to the Reuters analysis of the voter lists. In neighborhoods where Obama got less than 40 percent of the vote, 2.5 percent of registered voters were removed for that reason. In Franklin County, home to the state capital Columbus, 11 percent of voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods have been purged since 2012 due to inactivity. Only 6 percent of voters in Republican-leaning neighborhoods have been purged.   The disparity is especially stark in Hamilton County, where affluent Republican suburbs ring Cincinnati, which has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the country. In the heavily African-American neighborhoods near downtown, more than 10 percent of registered voters have been removed due to inactivity since 2012. In suburban Indian Hill, only 4 percent have been purged due to inactivity.  Overall, 30,000 voters have been removed due to inactivity since 2012, a larger figure than Obama’s margin of victory that year.   On a recent rainy afternoon, Amos Project canvasser Marcia Mackey tried to get some of those voters back in the system. Wielding a clipboard and a smile, Mackey asked pedestrians in the Over the Rhine neighborhood north of downtown Cincinnati when they last cast a ballot. If they couldn’t remember, she encouraged them to register again. “People don’t know they’ve been purged until they go to the election site and get turned away,” Mackey said. “We need to make sure that people have voices.” \n",

      " TITLE: Rainbow raids: Egypt launches its widest anti-gay crackdown yet\n",
      "TEXT: CAIRO (Reuters) - Sarah Hegazy has been jailed, beaten by inmates, and could face a life sentence in an Egyptian prison if found guilty of  promoting sexual deviancy  and other charges tied to her alleged crime: waving a rainbow flag at a concert. The 28-year-old denies waving the flag but is one of 57 people arrested so far in Egypt s widest anti-gay crackdown yet, a swift zero-tolerance response to a rare show of public support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in the conservative Muslim country. The crackdown comes as Egypt, a key Western ally in the Middle East, is under fire for its human rights record and the United States has withheld some of its $1.3 billion in annual military aid. Hegazy, the only woman rounded up in the three-week-old campaign, says police goaded her cellmates to abuse her during her first night in prison, where she is being detained for 15 days and interrogated by special prosecutors who usually focus on Islamist militants.  This is the game they (police) always play, especially since she is a girl. They incite the other detainees and say  this girl wants men and women to be gay  so they harass her. I saw scratches on her shoulder, she looked very disheveled and exhausted. She was beaten,  said Hegazy s lawyer Hoda Nasralla. A security official would not comment on Hegazy s case but denied that police incite prisoners against each other or otherwise mistreat them.  Lawyers for other detainees said their clients faced similar treatment. Suspected gay male detainees are subject to forced anal exams to determine if they have had homosexual sex, a procedure human rights groups say amounts to torture. At least five such examinations have taken place, Amnesty International says. Judicial sources do not deny the examinations take place but say they are legally carried out and are not a form of abuse. Egyptian authorities do not deny going after gays and an investigation report provided to Reuters by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) openly refers to the police s campaign on homosexuals. Police, state-aligned media, and the religious establishment all see it as a public duty to combat the spread of homosexuality.  Ten men have already gone on trial during the recent sweep and received jail sentences from one to six years. On Sept. 22, at a concert packed with 30,000 people headlined by Mashrou  Leila, a Lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay, a small group of concert goers raised a rainbow flag and, within hours, the image went viral. Almost immediately local media, dominated by state-aligned television personalities, began a campaign against homosexuals, saying they were receiving foreign funding, and hosting callers who compared their threat to Islamic State. Egypt s media regulator then banned homosexuals from appearing in the media unless they were  repenting , calling homosexuality a  shame and a disease that should be kept under wraps, not promoted  in order to protect public morality. Al-Azhar, Egypt s 1,000-year-old center of Islamic learning, said it would stand against gays in the way it stands against Islamist extremists. One church organized an anti-gay conference. Public Prosecutor Nabil Sadek ordered the State Security Prosecution, which normally investigates terrorism and other national security threats, to investigate the flag incident. At least four people, including Hegazy and 21-year-old Ahmed Alaa, were arrested for allegedly raising the flag although one man has since been released.  The overwhelming majority of those arrested are not involved in the flag case, however, and have simply been arrested over their perceived sexual orientation in the following days. Police have raided homes, parties, and used online dating apps to lure gay men - a common tactic in Egypt - to arrest most of them, their lawyers say. At a Cairo courthouse defendants stood in a cage, holding up newspapers and books to hide their faces to shield themselves from the stigma of homosexuality in Egyptian society. Although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in Egypt, it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife. Gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy. The last comparable crackdown on homosexuals in Egypt was in 2001, when police raided a floating disco called the Queen Boat. Fifty-two men were tried in the case, which drew widespread criticism from human rights groups and Western governments. But the current wave has already surpassed that incident both in numbers and in state action, with defendants facing much faster trials than usual, said Dalia Abd Elhameed, EIPR s gender and women s rights officer. No Western government has publicly condemned or commented on this crackdown, but Egypt is facing criticism from the United States, a major ally, over its human rights record. Washington denied Egypt $95.7 million in aid and delayed a further $195 million because it failed to make progress on  human rights and democracy, U.S. sources told Reuters in August. Egypt has taken a leading role at the United Nations in opposing gay rights. It was one of 13 countries to vote last week against a U.N. resolution condemning the death penalty for having gay sex.  It led a dozen states in boycotting a session in January with the first U.N. expert on anti-gay violence and discrimination. It sent a letter last year on behalf of Muslim countries to the secretary-general that led to the exclusion of 22 gay and transgender rights groups from the U.N. General Assembly s High Level Meeting on Ending Aids. Gay men and rights activists say the LGBT community has been facing an aggressive crackdown since 2013, when President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as military chief ousted Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Mursi.  EIPR has documented 232 cases between October 2013 and March 2017 where people were arrested for allegedly being gay or transgender, Abd Elhameed said. Many of these cases went to court where the average sentence was around three years in jail, although in some cases it went up to 12. Sisi has been criticized by the Brotherhood as being anti-Islam, and rights groups say tough treatment of the LGBT community is a way to counter that while diverting attention from the country s tough economic conditions. The crackdown has Egypt s already underground LGBT community living in fear. Five gay men who all requested anonymity said they were avoiding gay-friendly spaces and deleting online dating profiles for fear of arrest.  Some are considering leaving the country. But the recent developments underscore an existing reality for gay Egyptians: they are in constant physical danger.  I don t feel comfortable just being myself. We re not talking about gay rights here, no one is calling for marriage equality, we face the possibility of jail and humiliation for merely existing,  said one 25-year-old gay man. A 31-year-old gay man recounted how he was tied up and beaten at his Cairo flat last year by two men who threatened to kill him after meeting through the gay dating app Grindr. They posed as police officers at some point, playing on a common fear for gay Egyptians, before stealing items from his flat. The man says he later felt going to the police was almost as traumatic as the incident itself. Police records show officers create false dating profiles and set up dates only to arrest the men who show up. Sometimes they tell the men to bring condoms then use them as evidence, Abd Elhameed said.  There are people in the Interior Ministry who take our money as taxpayers to engage in sex chatting with people then arrest them. It is as ridiculous as this; the evidence sheets include nude photos and erotic chat transcripts.  \n",

      " TITLE: A Picture and its Story: Reaching out to rescue a Rohingya woman\n",
      "TEXT: PALONG KHALI, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Hannah McKay was on her first foreign assignment, just three months after joining Reuters, photographing Rohingya Muslims in refugee camps in Bangladesh. Then she and other photographers heard around 5,000 more people were heading to the area, trying to find their way across the border from neighbouring Myanmar. Here is her account of what happened next:  We were standing, looking out over paddy fields and grasslands   lots of water and one thin path leading to the border with Myanmar.   In the distance we could see a huge group of people. But they weren t moving. It was 4 o clock in the afternoon with only two hours left of daylight. So we decided to move towards them.   It took us about an hour along the muddy path, meeting border guards and persuading them to let us pass. Then we saw thousands of refugees just sitting there, with more Bangladeshi border guards telling us to go back.  We could see something was going on behind the crowd. So we waited for an opportunity to move closer, and that s when we saw them.   The crowd was sitting on a riverbank and behind them, about three meters below, in the river itself, there were just hundreds of refugees coming across every minute. It was non-stop. There was no end to the people. People carrying babies. Elderly people being escorted through the water and mud, more than knee-deep.  And we were just photographing everyone coming towards us.   Then this woman appeared. She got to the point where she needed to get up to the footpath where we were. But she was just exhausted. She didn t have anything left to get herself up. Two refugee men on her level were trying to push her up, which was when we reached out to help. Another Reuters photographer, Adnan Abidi, took a hand. Another photographer took another and I got her leg when she got within range. It was a case of dragging her.  She lay there for a few minutes and then, I have no idea what happened to her. There were so many people around and it was chaos.  We decided to get down into the river to get a different view. And it was so difficult   even for us who had some energy to spare. All the people around us had been walking for days. When I got back to the bank, I found I had nothing to hold onto, with two cameras weighing me down. That s when two refugee men reached out with their hands and pulled me on to the bank. I kept saying  Thank You , but they didn t understand.  It was overwhelming and made me think of the woman we had pulled out.   You are there trying to do your job with a camera in your hand. And then your heart overrules your head. I had been in the camps, where everything was quite settled. But then I saw the real chaos and the refugees  desperate situation. You hear about it. But seeing it is a completely different thing.

      " TITLE: A dead dictator, his rusting boat and a fight for history\n",
      "TEXT: RIJEKA, Croatia (Reuters) - In a Croatian port sits a boat built to carry bananas from Africa to Italy, that laid mines for Nazi Germany and was sunk by Allied planes before it was salvaged as the personal yacht of a globe-trotting communist leader. Josip Broz Tito and the state he led - Yugoslavia - have long passed into history, and the boat, the Galeb (Seagull), was left to rust in a corner of Rijeka s once mighty docks. Now, with Rijeka readying to become European Capital of Culture in 2020, city authorities have secured European Union money to restore the 117-metre (384-feet) boat as a museum, just as debate in Croatia rages over the life and deeds of the man who graced the pink mattress in the front port-side cabin. If the Galeb was a symbol of Tito s prestige on the world stage   a communist leader welcome in ports West as well as East   its restoration is part of Croatia s own tortured process of reconciliation with its 20th century history. To conservatives in Croatia, Tito   who was born in what is today Croatia to a Croat father and Slovene mother   was a totalitarian dictator: to look fondly on him means to be nostalgic for a shared federal state that denied Croats their own until they forged one in a 1991-95 war.  Liberals, however, recall his guerrilla fight against the Nazis and the relative freedom and prosperity of Yugoslavs compared to those who lived in the Soviet Union or in its shadow. They see in the disdain of conservatives a thinly veiled fondness for the World War Two Croatian state that collaborated with the Nazis but was snuffed out with Tito s Partisan victory   a sentiment that has gained a foothold in mainstream Croatian politics in recent years. It is a tug-of-war over history and identity that was encapsulated this month in the renaming by Zagreb s city council of the capital s Marshal Tito Square to Republic of Croatia square. Days later, the government ordered the removal of a plaque near the site of a World War Two concentration camp that bore a notorious slogan associated with the Nazi puppet regime in Croatia.  We live in a time when history is being reinvented retroactively,  said Ivan Sarar, who as head of culture at Rijeka s city council is in charge of its 2020 makeover.  It s interesting that just by undertaking this (restoration) we have already been declared revisionists,  he told Reuters. After years of false-starts, work on restoring the Galeb is imminent   a mammoth, multi-million-euro task to recreate the 1950s chic of Tito s floating palace, host to over 100 heads of state and some of Hollywood s finest.  Some of the furniture remains - in Tito s cabin, his turquoise-tiled bathroom and the adjacent salon with doors that open to the deck. But the ship itself is little more than a rotting hull. The Galeb was the stage for Tito s major contribution to history, said Sarar, a showcase for the non-aligned movement he helped found in answer to the East-West polarization of the Cold War. But Sarar stressed:  We won t be soft on anyone.  He noted Tito s cozy ties with dictators around the world, the exodus of Italian residents of Rijeka when he took the city as part of Yugoslavia, and his denial of democracy during 35 years of one-man rule until his death in 1980. Yugoslavia fell apart in war a decade later and some 135,000 people were killed. It was Tito s seizure of Rijeka and the Istrian peninsula that cemented his status in this part of Croatia as a liberator. Dozens of streets in Istria still bear his name, as do others in the Balkans - most notably in Serbia, once the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Conservatives, however, struck a blow with the renaming of Zagreb s Marshal Tito Square, part of a deal struck by the mayor to secure his majority in the city assembly. The man behind the initiative, leading right-wing politician Zlatko Hasanbegovic, told Reuters that while Tito was  undeniably a significant historical figure,  so were Napoleon, Stalin and Lenin.  In all countries, streets and squares bear the names of those who embody the values with which the entire nation identifies itself,  he said, describing the restoration of the Galeb as part of an attempt to revive the cult of Tito.   Those insisting on it should ask themselves how the tens of thousands of victims of Yugoslav communism look on that kind of quasi-cultural exhibitionism.  In Rijeka, Sarar denied planning any kind of homage to Tito.  We want to create a place for dialogue, away from the current situation of extreme black, white and red truths that lead nowhere,  he said.  It s bound to be difficult.  \n",

      "TEXT: MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin may have spent years reviling America, but Russians  hoping Donald Trump will usher in a new era of detente marked his inauguration on Friday with parties and trinkets from commemorative coins to “matryoshka” nesting dolls in his image. Washington was turned into a virtual fortress with an estimated 900,000 people — backers and protesters — descending on the capital. In London, anti-Trump activists draped a banner reading “Build Bridges Not Walls” from Tower Bridge. Protests were planned across western Europe on Friday and Saturday.  But according to Gennady Gudkov, a Putin critic and former lawmaker, Russia is in the grip of “Trumpomania”, with state media giving the President-elect blanket air time at the expense of more mundane and sometimes depressing domestic news stories. That, he said, was in part because the U.S. election, unlike elections in Russia, had been unpredictable. The Kremlin is hoping Trump will ease sanctions imposed over the annexation of Crimea, team up with Russia against Islamic State, and cut back NATO military activity near Russian borders. Craftsmen in the city of Zlatoust, east of Moscow, have released a limited series of silver and gold commemorative coins, engraved with “In Trump We Trust” - an allusion to the phrase on U.S. banknotes “In God We Trust”. Sellers of traditional matryoshka nesting dolls have added Trump dolls to their popular line-up of items carved in the likeness of President Vladimir Putin, Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, ex-President Mikhail Gorbachev and Josef Stalin. And a shop selling Russian military kit located opposite the U.S. embassy in Moscow has unveiled a cheeky promotional campaign offering embassy employees and U.S. citizens a 10 percent discount on its wares to celebrate Trump’s inauguration. Some of Trump’s opponents believe the Kremlin helped him win the White House by staging a hacking campaign to hoover up embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton, his rival. The Kremlin denies that, but few here make any secret of the fact that they are pleased that Trump and not Clinton triumphed.   Relations between Putin and Barack Obama had soured badly.   “Trump’s election has generated enormous enthusiasm in Russia because his warm words about Russia and Putin have given us hope that the USA and the West will stop their attack on Russia,” Sergei Markov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker, said on social media. “We don’t know for sure if there will be an improvement (in relations) or not. But we Russians are optimists ... so we are hoping for the best, while preparing for the worst.” For Russian nationalists, Trump’s inauguration is an excuse to mix fun with self-promotion. They are holding an all-night party at what used to be the main Soviet-era post office in Moscow where they will showcase their favorite prop, a  triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen. Konstantin Rykov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker and one of the event’s promoters, said on social media it was right to celebrate the first phase of the “New World Order.”       “Washington will be ours,” he quipped. \n",

      " TITLE: Lordy! Ex-FBI chief sets Twitter abuzz but @realDonaldTrump is silent\n",
      "TEXT: NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey’s long-anticipated congressional testimony set off a social media storm on Thursday with millions of people jumping into the fray but there was one notable absence - the tweeter in chief himself. President Donald Trump’s ordinarily red-hot Twitter handle, @realDonaldTrump, was dormant during the three-hour hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, although another Trump helped carry the mantle. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, live tweeted throughout Comey’s testimony, taking the ex-FBI director to task for his version of what the president told him. Twitter had a field day with other moments of Comey’s testimony, including his revelation that he broke a date with his wife in order to have dinner with Trump and his use of the exclamation “Lordy.” Comey’s disclosure that the person who leaked his memos of meeting with Trump was a Columbia Law School professor led to a stampede on the school’s website, causing it to crash. Here are some highlights of what excited Twitter during the testimony. Trump Jr. took issue with Comey’s comments about whether the president was ordering him to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. “Knowing my father for 39 years when he ‘orders or tells’ you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,” he tweeted.  (here) “Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that,” he concluded, adding the hashtag “#givemeabreak”. (here) With his father’s Twitter handle silent, @DonaldJTrumpJr became the 10th most mentioned Twitter handle in the Comey conversation, according to social media analysis firm Brandwatch. One remark in particular from Comey got the Twittersphere buzzing. “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” he told the committee regarding whether Trump had recorded their conversation. “Lordy” quickly became the focus of numerous memes, animated graphics and calls for T-shirts. Even the Merriam-Webster dictionary got into the act, tweeting out the definition of “Lordy” as a word used to “express surprise or strength of feeling.”  (here) Twitter said Comey’s “Lordy” remark was among the top three most tweeted moments during the testimony. Social media also poked fun when Comey revealed a presidential intrusion into his domestic life. “I had to call my wife and break a date with her,” Comey said. “I was supposed to take her out to dinner that night.”  “Moral of the #Comey testimony: Don’t cancel a date with your wife,” said CBS-Chicago reporter Jeremy Ross on Twitter. (here) Columbia Law School’s website became overburdened after Comey said he had asked a good friend who is a professor there to leak memos from his meeting with Trump to the media. Daniel Richman later confirmed to Reuters he was the one to whom Comey referred in his testimony. Shortly after the mention by Comey, the school tweeted: “Columbia Law’s site is down at the moment. We are working on a solution. Stay tuned.” (here) \n",

      " TITLE: Special Report: Why an emblematic American city has turned to Trump\n",
      "TEXT:  MUNCIE, Indiana (Reuters) - One night a month, retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago.  But the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics.  “It can get pretty heated,” says Gerald Poor, the group’s 77-year-old president, of their political discussions. “I call it to order if it gets out of hand.”  Their anger is understandable. The group is a remnant of a once-powerful United Auto Workers union local, which at its peak in the 1960s represented over 5,000 workers who made transmissions in Muncie for BorgWarner Inc, the global auto parts maker. An American flag drapes the wall at one end of the room, portraits of former labor bosses line the other, salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field.  For this group of mostly white, working-class men, the last two decades have brought much loss. In this election – with the victory of the populist Donald Trump as the Republican Party nominee and the strong run by the populist Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party crown – many say they feel they’re finally being heard again.  Working-class white men were once a force to be reckoned with in American politics. Many here speak wistfully of how John F. Kennedy stopped at BorgWarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in 1960. For these men, this year’s election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted.  In the primary, Trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in Delaware County, which encompasses Muncie. Just over 52 percent of Republican voters went for Trump. Democrats picked Sanders over Hillary Clinton by an even wider margin.  “Candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it,” says 66-year-old Bruce Reynolds, who followed his father and grandfather into a career at BorgWarner.  Gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling, abandoned factory, where he notes with precision that he worked for “32 and a half years,” he says he’s still skeptical of both side’s promises.  Neither Trump nor Clinton was his first choice. Reynolds and his wife voted for Sanders in the primary, he says. Among other things, they couldn’t support Clinton: She’s the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which many here blame for Muncie’s economic decline. They were uneasy with the often fiery rhetoric of Trump, the other side’s top candidate.  Yet both plan to vote for Trump in November, and Reynolds says they’ve grown comfortable with the choice.  “I know, it sounds like we’re confused,” he says. But they’re not.  Like many Trump supporters, he glides over the unappealing aspects of the candidate’s message to lock onto those that he likes. For Reynolds, it’s the hope of bringing back jobs for his children, some of whom still struggle to find decent work.  Trump’s gloomy world view is often dismissed as hyperbole, such as when he described crime and collapsed economies in America’s cities at the Republican National Convention. But for someone in Muncie, that’s not far off reality.  An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of America’s white working-class men.  In 2000, white men with less than a college degree accounted for about three-quarters of all white men living in the county. By 2014, their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points, according to the US Census Bureau. But while this group’s share of the population held relatively steady, the earnings of white men with full-time jobs had fallen dramatically.  In 2000, 47 percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners, with incomes of $50,000 or less, based on 2015 dollars. By 2014, 60 percent of them were in the bottom third.  Meanwhile, the percentage of white men in full-time jobs making between $50,000 and $100,000 dropped from 43 percent to 32 percent. And the percentage in the ranks of earners above $100,000 slipped from 11 percent to 8 percent.  In essence, white men in Muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder. They have clustered at the bottom, poorer and more isolated than ever before, even as the overall U.S. economy has grown and globalized.  The same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from New Jersey and upstate New York to Alabama and Kentucky.  According to the data, in about 1,800 counties across the United States—nearly 60 percent of those where data is available—the share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period. The trend is particularly pronounced in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.  Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, studies how people adopt their political beliefs. “Trump is the first candidate to speak to—and speak for—working-class white men in a long time,” Haidt says. That separates him from the last two Republican nominees. Mitt Romney, who lost in 2012, didn’t do that, “and John McCain didn’t particularly reach out to that constituency” in 2008.  As for Trump’s extreme positions and outright falsehoods, Haidt notes, “If your hero says things that are untrue, you’ll cut him slack.”  Muncie was once the epitome of America’s muscular manufacturing economy. After natural gas was discovered here late in the 19th century, the city attracted dozens of energy-intensive glass manufacturers, most notably Ball Corp, which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars.  The auto industry followed, and Muncie became a hub for transmission making. The term “Muncie transmission” is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by General Motors Corp in the 1960s. One particularly powerful version is the “rock crusher,” used in Corvettes and other muscle cars.  BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, has even deeper roots in Muncie than GM. Warner Gear was founded here in 1901 and merged with other businesses to create what became BorgWarner in the late 1920s. Many former workers here still call it Warner Gear.  In the 1920s, a husband-and-wife team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical American community. They called it “Middletown,” to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole. Muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them.  The Center for Middletown Studies—at Ball State University—has continued the work, compiling oral histories and, in recent years, focused on the devastation of deindustrialization. James Connolly, a history professor who runs the center, says that more than anything else, Muncie’s working-class white men feel a loss of power. When the big factories were humming, the unions were an unstoppable force—not just for getting good paychecks and lush benefits, but a voice in almost everything else.  To illustrate this power, he cites a locally famous episode from the 1960s, when waitresses at a big downtown hotel went on strike for higher wages.  “A group of police got rough and tried to break up the pickets,” says Connolly. A local union leader—who had nothing to do with the waitresses, other than knowing about them through community connections—called the then-mayor, who was visiting Washington, and “ordered him home” to intervene. The mayor returned and the police backed off.  “The strikers weren’t union members—but there was a system of connections that gave them a sense of control,” says Connolly. With the decline of the unions, working-class people “feel like they’ve been robbed of that voice.”  And yet unions, which were unable to prevent the factory closures that ravaged the city, are often viewed just as suspiciously here as most national politicians are. That tension is visible at the old school where the BorgWarner retirees meet.  The Muncie Delaware County Senior Center was created to give retirees from the big factories—particularly men—a place to go for companionship and activities. One recent day, the room the BorgWarner retirees use was filled with seniors learning line dancing.  “Some people don’t like the photos” of the union leaders, says Jim Shields, a janitor, motioning toward the 10 portraits that adorn the front of the room. They feel the images carry an implicitly political, pro-union message. So, there was a fuss the last time the building was used as a polling station, he said. “We had complaints.” Now, when the BorgWarner retiree group isn’t meeting, Shields carefully drapes a long bolt of fabric over the pictures to conceal them.  Michael Hicks, a Ball State economist who studies manufacturing, says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for Trump. “It’s always easier to blame a larger force for your problems, whether that’s Mexicans or greedy factory owners,” he says. “But these people aren’t stupid. They know the jobs aren’t coming back.” The bigger concern for many of them, he says, is what will happen to their children.  The Reynolds family is a good example. Bruce Reynolds’s oldest son, Bruce Jr, is a Baptist pastor and is supporting Trump, albeit reluctantly. “I don’t think any of them can fix it,” Bruce Jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation, from growing drug addiction to broken families.  Reynolds’s second son, Robert, followed his father into BorgWarner after high school. That job didn’t last. After just four years, he was laid off in 1994 during a wave of downsizing. He and his father say it was a trauma from which he never fully recovered.  “I make $8 an hour less now than I made 21 years ago,” says Robert, who enthusiastically backs Trump. After a series of low-paying jobs, including a stint at Wal-Mart and as a manager of a video store, he now works overnight shifts at a warehouse for $18 an hour. He likes the job, he says, although the company recently cut three paid holidays, including the Fourth of July.  Robert concedes that he finds the Republican candidate’s approach to foreign policy worrisome. “You wonder if something will upset him and he’ll declare war,” he says. “That would be awful.” He also doesn’t like how race and immigration has become a theme in the campaign. “This country was built on bring us your tired, your poor—I think we should honor what our forefathers built,” he says.  But he also doesn’t believe Trump’s message is racist. “I think he’s looking at all the illegal activity going on in the U.S. and how it affects the job market,” he says. “He’s just not very tactful” in how he expresses this. Meanwhile, Trump’s promise to restore the economy is the draw.  To be sure, Muncie has retained some of its smaller factories, and other jobs have come in, including a call center that tracks down delinquent student loans and a Caterpillar Inc locomotive factory that moved into an old plant. But none of these are unionized, and the wages and benefits aren’t as high as the old places offered.  One frustration for locals is that the statistical measures of the economy don’t seem to reflect what they see around them. Muncie’s jobless rate is 5.7 percent, less than one percentage point higher than the national rate of 4.9 percent or Indiana’s 4.6 percent.  But the impact of deindustrialization—including the exodus of over 10,000 factory jobs since 1970 in a city of only 70,000 people—is visible almost everywhere.  Most of the departing companies tore down their factories, leaving lots strewn with weeds and rubble. BorgWarner left a handful of structures—including a 1.2 million-square-foot sprawl of red brick and steel near the edge of town.  The city, especially the once-thriving white working-class neighborhoods on the south side, is now dotted with over 2,000 abandoned houses. Some can’t be occupied because they were contaminated by chemicals left behind by meth labs.  Meanwhile, the FBI recently opened a probe of the city government, which appears to be focused on possible corruption in its blight clearing program and the sanitation district. The FBI wouldn’t comment on the investigation, and Mayor Dennis Tyler said he can’t talk about it. There have been no indictments in the case, and it’s possible no charges will result.  Mayor Tyler, a Democrat, notes the jobless rate stood just under 10 percent four years ago, when he took office, so there’s been improvement. But he understands working-class frustration.  “They feel they’ve intentionally been left behind by trade agreements this country imposed on them over the last 25 years,” says Tyler.  Trump’s appeal here isn’t restricted to working-class white men. Another local supporter is Todd Murray, president and CEO of family-owned Mursix Corp, which makes auto parts including tiny switches that go inside door locks and interior lights. His company has grown rapidly in recent years and now employs over 300 people.  Murray says he knows some of Trump’s trade proposals—such as putting hefty tariffs on goods from Mexico and China—could hit his own business. He exports 60 percent of his output, mostly to Mexico, and operates his own small plant in China. But he insists he’s “not smart enough to know how that would all shake out.” He still strongly favors the Republican standard bearer, who he sees as more pro-business.  But the economy alone doesn’t explain Trump’s appeal. Another family with deep roots at BorgWarner is the Lephart clan. At one point in the 1950s and 1960s, the patriarch and nine of his sons worked there, a fact immortalized in the company magazine by a photo of the group posed on a tall step ladder, each holding a lunch bucket, except for the brother at the top, who holds the family dog.  David Lephart, whose father is one of the nine brothers, avoided the decline entirely through shrewd job-hopping and retraining—but he’s still a Trump supporter. He commutes to a UAW job as a pipefitter at a GM plant in Marion, Indiana. He earns about $100,000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his children through college.  The 58-year-old says one thing that influenced his transition from Democrat to Republican was talking to his children, whom he describes as part of the “business world.” His son is now a stockbroker in Indianapolis.  “For the first half of my life, I thought Democrat was the only way to be,” Lephart says. “There’s this belief that you can’t be Republican and union—but I don’t believe that any more.”  \n",

      " TITLE: Hacked emails raise possibility of Clinton Foundation ethics breach\n",
      "TEXT: SEATTLE, Wash. (Reuters) - Hacked emails published by Wikileaks this week appear to show Qatar pledging to donate $1 million to Hillary Clinton’s family’s charitable foundation, despite her promise to curb new donations by foreign governments while U.S. secretary of state. In an email from 2012, a senior official from the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation informs colleagues that a planned donation by Qatar’s government to mark Bill Clinton’s birthday came up in a meeting he had with the Gulf state’s ambassador in Washington. The ambassador said that he asked “to see WJC ‘for five minutes’ in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for WJC’s birthday in 2011,” Amitabh Desai, the foundation official, writes in his email, using the former U.S. president’s initials.  Hillary Clinton, who is the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, served as secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. The hacked email is among thousands published over the last week by the pro-transparency group Wikileaks from the account of John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.  Clinton’s campaign has been embarrassed by this and similar recent hacking attacks on other Democratic Party officials, some of which appear to show Clinton and her aides saying things in private that contradict their public positions. Her spokesmen have not disputed the authenticity of the hacked emails.  The emails released by Wikileaks do not appear to confirm whether Qatar gave the promised $1 million, although the foundation’s website lists the State of Qatar as having given at least that amount. There is no date listed for the donation. A spokesman for the foundation declined to confirm the donation. Reuters could not rule out the possibility the $1 million was intended as a birthday present for Clinton personally, not for the foundation. His spokesman did not respond to questions. Hillary Clinton promised the U.S. government that while she served as secretary of state the foundation would not accept new funding from foreign governments without seeking clearance from the State Department’s ethics office.  The agreement was designed to dispel concerns that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by donations to the foundation, which is known for its work on reducing the cost of HIV medicine in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinton’s Republican rival in the presidential election, Donald Trump, has seized on the foundation for political attacks, calling it a front for corruption. Clinton’s campaign dismisses this as a political smear.  The State Department has said it cannot cite any instances of its ethics officials reviewing or approving new donations from foreign governments to the foundation while Clinton served as the country’s top diplomat from 2009 until 2013.  “You would need to ask the Foundation whether there were additional matters that it should have submitted for State Department review,” the department said in a statement. The ethics agreement allowed foreign governments that already supported foundation projects to continue while Clinton was at the State Department. However, if one of those governments wanted to “increase materially its commitment,” then the foundation was required to ask the department first. Craig Minassian, a foundation spokesman, declined to confirm if Qatar gave the $1 million described in the 2012 email. Even if it had, he said he questioned whether the money would be considered a “material increase.” He said Qatar has been donating since 2002, and that some of those donations have been greater than $1 million. Qatar’s embassy in Washington did not respond to questions. A spokesman for Clinton, who was campaigning in Seattle on Friday, also did not resond to questions. Last year, Reuters found that at least seven other foreign governments made new donations to the foundation without the State Department being informed, partly, foundation officials said, because of “oversights.”  President Barack Obama is campaigning for Clinton to be elected his successor, and the White House has repeatedly declined to discuss the breaches of the agreement Clinton signed with Obama’s administration. \n",

      " TITLE: CIA director warns Trump to watch what he says, be careful on Russia\n",
      "TEXT: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - CIA Director John Brennan on Sunday offered a stern parting message for Donald Trump days before the Republican U.S. president-elect takes office, cautioning him against loosening sanctions on Russia and warning him to watch what he says. Brennan rebuked Trump for comparing U.S. intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany in comments by the outgoing CIA chief that reflected the extraordinary friction between the incoming president and the 17 intelligence agencies he will begin to command once he takes office on Friday. In an interview with “Fox News Sunday,” Brennan questioned the message sent to the world if the president-elect broadcasts that he does not have confidence in the United States’ own intelligence agencies. “What I do find outrageous is equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany. I do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly,” Brennan said. Brennan’s criticism followed a tumultuous week of finger-pointing between Trump and intelligence agency leaders over an unsubstantiated report that Russia had collected compromising information about Trump. The unverified dossier was summarized in a U.S. intelligence report presented to Trump and outgoing President Barack Obama this month that concluded Russia tried to sway the outcome of the Nov. 8 election in Trump’s favor by hacking and other means. The report did not make an assessment on whether Russia’s attempts affected the election’s outcome. Trump has accused the intelligence community of leaking the dossier information, which its leaders denied. They said it was their responsibility to inform the president-elect that the allegations were being circulated. Later on Sunday, Trump took to Twitter to berate Brennan and wrote, “Was this the leaker of Fake News?” In a separate posting, Trump scolded “those intelligence chiefs” for presenting the dossier as part of their briefing. “When people make mistakes, they should APOLOGIZE,” he wrote. Brennan also sounded an alarm on U.S. relations with Russia. Trump has vowed to improve relations with Moscow even as he faces criticism that he is too eager to make an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Trump does not yet have a full understanding of Russia’s actions, Brennan said, noting its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine, its support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war and Moscow’s aggressive activities in the cyber realm. “Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia of various actions it has taken in the past number of years is a road that he, I think, needs to be very, very careful about moving down,” Brennan said. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Friday, Trump suggested he might do away with sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia in late December in response to the cyber attacks if Moscow proves helpful in battling terrorists and reaching other U.S. goals. Brennan also said Trump needs to be mindful about his off-the-cuff remarks once he assumes the presidency, alluding to Trump’s penchant for making broad pronouncements on Twitter. “Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests,” Brennan said. “So therefore when he speaks or when he reacts, just make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the United States could be profound.” “It’s more than just about Mr. Trump. It’s about the United States of America,” Brennan said. Trump has picked Mike Pompeo, a Republican member of the House of Representatives and a former U.S. Army officer, to replace Brennan. Trump’s comments about Putin and his reluctance to assign blame to Moscow for the hacking of Democratic political groups has opened him up to criticism that he will be too soft on Russia. For months, Trump had publicly expressed doubt about U.S. intelligence conclusions on the cyber attacks before acknowledging at a news conference on Wednesday that he thought Russia was behind the hacking. Vice President-elect Mike Pence told “Fox News Sunday,”     “What the president-elect is determined to do is to explore the possibility of better relations.” Pence did not say whether Trump would undo some of the sanctions and diplomatic expulsions Obama had slapped on Moscow. Pence confirmed that Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, held conversations with the Russian ambassador to Washington around the time the sanctions were imposed, but said the talks “were not in any way related to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats.” However, Pence denied that Trump’s team had any contact with Russian officials during the presidential campaign. “Of course not,” he told Fox. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said on Friday they will investigate alleged Russian attempts to influence the election and links between Russia and the political campaigns. \n",

      " TITLE: Trump? Clinton? Many young Americans prefer giant meteor, poll finds\n",
      "TEXT:  (The 18 October 2016 story was refiled to correct the typo in the last sentence to read likely “voters”) By Scott Malone BOSTON (Reuters) - Young Americans are so dissatisfied with their choices in this presidential election that nearly one in four told an opinion poll they would rather have a giant meteor destroy the Earth than see Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in the White House. The tongue-in-cheek question was intended to gauge young Americans’ level of unhappiness about their choices in the Nov. 8 election, said Joshua Dyck, co-director of UMass Lowell’s Center for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll alongside Odyssey, a social media platform. The choice alluded to the Twitter hashtag “#GiantMeteor2016,” a reference to an imaginary presidential candidate used to express frustration about this year’s election choices. Some 53 percent of the 1,247 people aged 18 to 35 said they would prefer to see a meteor destroy the world than have Republican New York real estate developer Trump in the Oval Office, with some 34 percent preferring planetary annihilation to seeing the Democratic former Secretary of State win. Some 39 percent said they would prefer that U.S. President Barack Obama declare himself president for life than hand over power to Clinton or Trump, with 26 percent saying the nation would do better to select its next leader in a random lottery. Some 23 percent, nearly one in four, preferred the giant meteor outcome to either Trump or Clinton. “Obviously we don’t think that they’re serious,” Dyck said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “The fact that one in four of our young people pick ‘Giant Meteor’ tells you something about the political disaffection that is being shown by American youth.” That contrasts with the surge of participation by young voters that helped propel Obama into the White House for his first term in the 2008 election. When asked to choose between the actual candidates, Clinton easily led Trump with 54 percent of respondents to 21 percent in a two-way race. In a four-way race also including Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton led with 48 percent support, to Trump’s 20 percent, Johnson’s 10 percent and Stein’s 4 percent. In national polls surveying the whole population, Clinton is leading Trump, but not by nearly as much. The poll, conducted Oct. 10-13, intentionally included a large number of people seen as unlikely to vote, with just 680 described as likely voters. It had a margin of error of 3.2 percent. \n",

      " TITLE: OBAMACARE: Your Dog Might Have Better Healthcare Than You Do\n",
      "TEXT: Simon Black Sovereign ManBelow is a short email that my friend Sam posted this morning to his Facebook page about his surprisingly positive experience with the US healthcare system.I thought it a fantastic read, and I wanted to pass it along to you:I had to run to the emergency room today for what may be a neurological issue. Dizziness, staggering, loss of balance, that kind of thing.I m in San Diego, one of the most expensive cities in the world, and I have no insurance. I figured I was screwed.But instead, the experience was unreal.I got seen immediately. I didn t even have time to sit down, they just whisked me into an examination room.The doctor and nurse were ON IT, and they took their time with the exam and consultation.The visit ultimately involved staying the whole day for observation, all kinds of tests, sedation and reversal, blood pressure check, a full blood panel work up (results tomorrow, yes TOMORROW keep your fingers crossed) and having both ears cleaned and flushed.The bill was a mere $374.63.Do I have some insane insurance plan? Nope.Am I being super-subsidized by the rest of America? Nope.Am I a privileged politician with a special  bosses only  healthcare plan? Don t make me laugh.It turns out that the care was for my dog, not for me. And we didn t go to a  people  hospital  I obviously took my dog to an animal hospital.She and I are both biological machines, mammals made mostly of water (though she sheds more than I do).The only other real difference is that the government is regulating the hell out of healthcare for people, while (relatively speaking), leaving healthcare for animals alone.And that, my friends, is the reason Obamacare has flopped, and why your healthcare costs will keep going up.It s not greed. It s not the drug companies. It s not anything other than the application of government intervention in what should be a free market.Simon again.It s not exactly controversial these days to suggest that the US healthcare system is in bad shape.According to data collected by numerous independent agencies like the Institute of Medicine, Commonwealth Fund, and Kaiser Family Foundation, the US still ranks dead last among advanced economies in overall quality of its healthcare system.In fact, the US healthcare system has the worst record in the number of deaths caused by mistakes or inefficient care.And wait times in the US for urgent care and primary care visits rank lower than every other developed nation.Americans pay at least 50% more for healthcare in terms of annual spending than people in other advanced nations, yet they receive less care as measured by the number of doctor visits.Sure, it s great that there are fewer uninsured people than ever before in the US, but this is a measure of QUANTITY, not a measure of QUALITY.Undoubtedly the US is home to some of the finest medical professionals in the world.But they ve been buried under an expensive, over-regulated bureaucracy that continues to erode overall quality in the system.A 2015 report from the National Academy of Sciences summed it up by stating,  For Americans, health care costs and expenditures are the highest in the world, yet health outcomes and care quality are below average by many measures. But instead of trying to understand WHY the system is so slow, bureaucratic, and expensive to begin with, politicians try to  fix  it by creating more regulations Continue this story at Sovereign ManREAD MORE OBAMACARE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Obamacare Files\n",

      " TITLE:  Cops Put Trump-Backed Breitbart To SHAME For Fake 1,000-Muslim Mob Attack Story\n",
      "TEXT: Donald Trump loves the right-wing, white supremacist  news  publication Breitbart so much that he snagged their former executive chair, white supremacist Steve Bannon, to serve as his chief strategist in the White House. But Bannon s propaganda rag recently demonstrated some behavior that most of us find cringeworthy (while Trump and friends are surely cheering) when they decided a story about a small fireworks fire needed a bit of spice.According to Breitbart in a story headlined  Revealed: 1,000-man mob attack police, set Germany s oldest church alight on New Year s Eve,  a crowd of  at least 1,000 young  Muslim  men  began throwing fireworks into a crowd of families with children before setting fire to a church. When police asked them to stop, the  mob  began to throw fireworks at cops instead. So sayeth Breitbart. Writer Virginia Hale adds:Also reported by the Ruhr Nachrichten was that  a group of Syrians sang in celebration of the ceasefire in Syria.  However, a video posted to Twitter by one of the newspaper s reporters, paired with the caption  Syrians celebrate the truce in their country,  shows a group of men chanting  Allahu Akhbar  around the flag of al-Qaeda and Islamic State collaborators, the  Free Syrian Army. Unsurprisingly, the video she posted did not show an ISIS flag in the least, nor did it show anyone throwing fireworks at anyone:#Silvester in #Dortmund: Syrer feiern den Waffenstillstand in ihrem Land. pic.twitter.com/Yxom6nY5QC  Peter Bandermann (@RN_Bandermann) December 31, 2016Police confirm, however, that nothing  extraordinary or spectacular  had actually occurred   and they want the right-wing lie-rag to knock it the f*ck off.Ruhr Nachrichten, the local newspaper cited in the Breitbart report, says that numerous elements of the story had been twisted by Breitbart to produce what they call in no uncertain terms fake news, hate and propaganda.  They explain that Wolf took numerous unconnected incidents, exaggerated them, and threw them together with the sole purpose of creating a false image of Muslims as terrorists.This Breitbart story has even prompted the justice minister of the Hesse state, Eva K hne-H rmann, to warn that the danger is that these stories spread with incredible speed and take on lives of their own. In reality, stray fireworks started a small fire on netting covering the scaffolding on the church. The fire was extinguished in 12 minutes, the roof was never on fire, and   contrary to Breitbart s report s claim   the church isn t even the oldest in Germany. In reality, police say they handled 185 missions that night   a sharp drop from the 421 they responded to in 2015. In fact, leadership says that the night was  rather average to quiet. The story is still online without a single correction, apology, note, or alteration   because the truth is that Breitbart s readers simply don t care about the truth.Featured image via screengrab\n",

      " TITLE:  Israeli PM Netanyahu Quoted In Full Throated Support of Ethnically Cleansing Palestinians\n",
      "TEXT: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has always advocated for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, but has dressed himself up as someone who wants peace, all the while continuing to steal Palestinian land for Jewish settlements and to deny Palestinians their civil and political rights on lands in which Israel controls. In a November, 1989 speech, Netanyahu said: Israel should have exploited China s suppression of the demonstrations [Tienanmen Square], at a time when the world s attention was devoted to events in that country, in order to conduct mass expulsions of the Arabs [sic] of the Occupied Territories. However, to my sorrow, they [government ministers] didn t support the policy I espoused and whose implementation I continue to recommend. Most of the world knows Netanyahu is not a peace maker. Yet, Israeli apologists will argue that if only Israel would elect someone from other  moderate  parties in Israel, then he/she would take a softer stance on Palestinians and thus peace could be achieved. However, those who believe this nonsense are naive. Israel has a deep rooted culture of ethnic cleansing that dates back to the early Zionists and it is at the very core of today s Israel.When the first Zionist delegation came to Palestine from Europe in the 19th century looking to colonize the country and create their Jewish state, they declared that the  Bride is beautiful but she s married to another man,  meaning that there was already an existing people and culture in the country   the Palestinians. However, that didn t stop the Zionists from pursuing their agenda of wanting to create a Jewish state despite the fact that 97% of the population wasn t Jewish. We must keep in mind that the ideology of Zionism advocates not only for a Jewish state but the state must be majority Jewish. Thus, a major dilemma for the Zionists was how to create a majority Jewish state in a country where the majority of the population wasn t Jewish. The answer was to bring European Jews to the country on the one hand and to pursue the policy of ethnically cleansing Palestinians on the other.That Zionist culture of ethnic cleansing came into fruition in 1948. Despite massive European Jewish immigration into the country for 50 years, the Jewish population never reached a majority, accounting for about 30% of the population. Thus, in order to attain the majority Jewish state, David Ben-Gurion, who would later become Israel s first prime minister, unleashed Operation Plan Dalet, a campaign of ethnic cleansing that saw the destruction of hundreds of villages and the forced expulsion of close to a million Palestinians out of the country. Today, they and their descendants number in the millions.In 1967, Israel conquered the remaining 20% of Palestine, taking the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Despite the fact that close to 300,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed, the majority managed to remain on their lands and today the West Bank s 2.5 million Palestinians are a thorn in the side of the Zionists who have been building settlements in the heart of Palestinian communities throughout the West Bank and thirst for more Palestinian land. The United Nations considers Israel s presence in the West Bank and Gaza to be illegal and their building of settlements to be in violation of the fourth Geneva Conventions. Yet, Israel continues building, confiscating lands, blowing up Palestinian property to make way for Israeli expansion and then killing Palestinians when they complain and labeling them as terrorists when they resist.Calls for the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians continues to this day. While Netanyahu is currently the prime-minister, a new generation of Israelis have called for the violent removal of Palestinians. The calls for crimes against humanity are thus not isolated to a few politicians in Israel but are at the very fabric of the ideology of Zionism and its adherents.

      " TITLE:  Americans Were Asked By A Poll To Pick One Word To Describe Trump, And The Result Will ENRAGE Him\n",
      "TEXT: Get ready for Donald Trump to throw the worst temper tantrum of his presidency.When you think of Trump, what s the first word that comes to your mind? That s the question that a new Quinnipiac poll asked Americans.Trump has often bragged that he has  the best words,  but this poll makes it clear that Americans had the best words to describe him. And they are words that even Trump can understand. Idiot  is the top word Americans used to answer the poll, followed by  incompetent  and  liar. Americans also used words such as, asshole, unqualified, ignorant, racist, embarrassment, narcissist, bully, arrogant, dishonest, bigot, buffoon, blowhard, clown, and greedy, just to list a few.Adding insult to injury, Trump s approval rating reached a new low in the poll. Only 36 percent approve while 58 percent disapprove.In addition, 61 percent say Trump is not honest and 56 percent say he does not have good leadership skills.The poll also shows that Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the way Trump talks about the media 65 percent to 31 percent. Most, 57 percent, also trust the media more than him to tell the truth, a statistic that will likely send Trump off the deep end.Americans also want Democrats to take back control of the Senate.Overall, it s pretty damn clear that the American people loathe Trump. And even though Trump will try to spin the numbers or use Fox News propaganda to dispute them, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll Tim Malloy says Trump really is out of excuses at this point. There is no way to spin or sugarcoat these sagging numbers,  Malloy said.And this poll was taken long before Trump s embarrassing overseas trip to Poland and the G-20 Summit in Germany, where Trump kissed Putin s ass for two hours and offered to let Russia work on American cyber security despite the fact that Russia has been launching cyber attacks against our nation.So it s likely Americans would use even more negative words to describe Trump if they could pick again.Trump is going to blow a gasket when he learns of this poll and you can bet the hissy fit will be public for all to see because Trump is thin-skinned, which curiously was not a word Americans thought of for the poll. Maybe they will next time.Featured Image: Isaac Brekken/Getty Images\n",

      " TITLE: Coke Zero: What Went Wrong With The Marco Rubio Brand?\n",
      "TEXT: Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireAny business expert will tell you that marketing is not an exact science. The same is true in politics, and even more so in this historic election season. As the polls closed yesterday, Republican candidate and US Senator Marco Rubio took to the podium to announce he was finally bowing out the GOP presidential primary race. Front runner Donald Trump nearly swept the board starting with Rubio s home state of Florida, followed by Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and in US territory Mariana Islands, while Ohio governor John Kasich took the remaining contest winning his first primary race ,in his home state.With 99 delegates at stake in a winner take all contest, Florida was meant to be Rubio s gallant last stand. Even though the polls showed Rubio trailing in double digits before Tuesday, Rubio still insisted he was going to win, and even go on to win the nomination.Marco: A smile you can trust.. Quite frankly, I think a lot of people are going to be embarrassed tonight and are going to want refunds from the money they spent on those polls because we re going to win Florida,  said Rubio.  We feel very optimistic about that. When it was all said and done, Trump beat Rubio 46% to 27% in Florida. A blow out.By the end of his long drive, Rubio had only managed to win one state caucus in Minnesota, leaving him with no real primary victory. To his investors, the truth of the  matter might be almost too painful to comprehend  that beyond all the hype, their man was really a bottom tier candidate.Super Tuesday s humiliating loss was indicative of a Rubio rise  that never rose. Before Tuesday s defeat, no matter how poorly Florida Senator Marco Rubio showed in previous primary elections, and no matter how badly he was polling in his home state of Florida   the media, led by CNN and FOX News, still covered his campaign like he was winning the election. Clearly, there was a concerted and well-coordinated effort by the Republican establishment and major broadcast media outlets to promote Rubio s candidacy well above the actual candidate s weight division.Three weeks ago, in a last-ditch effort to elevate his poll numbers, Rubio tried to out-Trump Trump, by unleashing his own round of back-ally personal verbal insults at the front runner in the hope of pulling The Donald back down to earth. Rubio began publicly calling Trump a  con man  and asserted that Trump had not achieved anything in his business career and along with fellow competitor Ted Cruz, inferred that the billionaire property and entertainment mogul Trump had inherited $200 million dollars from his late father and therefore was not deserving of any accolades. When Trump would joke about Rubio s lack of height (Rubio is 5 8  and Trump is 6 2 ), Rubio hit back joking,  look how small Donald s hands are, and you what they say about men with small hands..  to his crowds roaring with laughter before the Texas primary three weeks earlier.Trump finally hit back with a moniker that Rubio could never shake, renaming him  Little Marco.  LITTLE MARCO: Trump s crude deconstruction of Rubio delivered the final blow.Although their cage match pulled more TV airtime and attention away from a Trump-obsessed media, in the end it backfired horribly for Marco, as America got an uncomfortable snapshot of a nasty and desperate Rubio   hardly the look of stability, moderation and  unity that Rubio marketeers were trying to project, and hardly presidential either.What was most telling about Rubio s response to a situation, partly of his own making, was that Rubio shirked any responsibility for ratcheting-up the rhetoric, and instead tried to blame Trump for the degrading  tone  of the election: This is a frightening, grotesque and disturbing development in American politics,  Rubio said of the violence.  We are being ripped apart at the seams now,  he continued.  I m sad for this country. This is supposed to be the example to the world of how a republic functions and instead people are watching third-world images last night coming out of Chicago. It was too late. The damage was already done. Some pundits were calling it  political suicide  by Rubio   a gross error of political miscalculation on his part. But this would be missing the point because in reality, beyond all the incredible marketing hype, Rubio s campaign never achieved any serious market penetration to begin with.It s important to remember that the establishment firmly believed, and still to this day, that Marco Rubio could be the Republican Party s answer to the marketing sensation that was Barack Obama in 2008. By capitalizing on his youth and his Latino profile, the GOP elite saw this as a  turn-key  marketing solution. Just like a soda pop brand, party and media operatives believed that by positioning Rubio s brand in a highbrow market tier, voters would make the necessary connections and move to act by casting their vote for him. DETATCHED: Darryl Issa throws himself under the bus,, desperate to inflate Rubio before Super Tuesday.On Super Tuesday, the transmission truly fell out of the Rubio marketing machine. After months of boasting about how he would win his home state, Rubio plugger and California Congressman Darryl Issa (R), insisted that,  Marco is leading in early (voting) returns in Florida. Seriously, Congressman Issa?Issa appeared to be carrying water for the GOP establishment by doing the last minute media rounds for kingmaker Mitt Romney, who weeks earlier dropped the gauntlet down on the Trump train during a speech at the University of Utah. Romney,  a former Republican presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor implored his GOP herd to join forces and stop Trump by splitting the votes by voting for Kasich in Ohio, and for Rubio in Florida. Romney hoped  that his divide and conquer strategy would rob Trump of the delegate majority needed to secure the GOP nomination before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio this July. JET-SET: Rubio taking instructions from elite off-shoring corporate raider Mitt Romney.Clearly, Romney had staked his claim behind Marco Rubio then, which means that Rubio s collapse in Florida has half deflated Romney s Revolt.Romney continued to dig a hole for himself in Florida before Super Tuesday by recording an automated  Robo-call used to phone prospective Marco Rubio voters in Florida, nearly begging voters to cast ballots for,  a candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton and who can make us proud. The recorded message went on:  If we Republicans were to choose Donald Trump as our nominee, I believe that the prospects for a safe and prosperous future would be greatly diminished   and I m convinced Donald Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton. Making Robo-calls for a candidate who people were already calling  a Robot , wasn t exactly a smart move by Romney.Far from swinging the election towards Rubio, what Mitt Romney really proved was that money and power can t buy common sense.Ghost RunFor anyone who actually bothered to look close enough, hints of Rubio s collapse were everywhere, but you wouldn t know if from media coverage over the last two months. If not for favorable network face-time on the GOP TV debates, along with Rubio s elite financier backers like billionaire Paul Singer and Cayman hedge fund raider Romney, it s safe to say that Rubio s numbers might had been well below those of his fellow non-starter, Ohio Governor John Kasich.Rubio-linked multi-million dollar Super PAC funds pulled out all the stops against Trump too, launching a social media tidal wave of anti-Trump messages before the Florida primary:If every Rubio supporter makes 1 phone call #MarcoRubio will win! Convince 1 voter to vote for Marco! #CallForMarco pic.twitter.com/d8wOKZWFA4  Stop Trump PAC (@StopTrumpPAC) March 15, 2016Last Wednesday, Rubio hired out a football stadium to stage a homecoming rally in his own state. Unfortunately, no one showed up. TV cameras had to be moved forward into a tiny area around the field s goal posts in order to make the rally look as if more than a few hundred people bothered to show up. Far from jovial and inspirational, the atmosphere was that of deflation and despondency. It was tragic.Rubio stadium event in Hialeah. Stands empty; crowd in one end zone. pic.twitter.com/9zj0xslwSA  Byron York (@ByronYork) March 9, 2016 And when the cameras zoomed-in, it looked like this:The crowd in Hialeah is fired up for @marcorubio tonight! #FLforMarco #FLPrimary pic.twitter.com/e34GsoWWwH  Team Marco (@TeamMarco) March 9, 2016CNN had dispatched one of its intrepid city-dwelling reporters, Jason Carroll, out to Hialeah, Florida to  cover the event. Carrol tried be nice about it, describing the event as  much, much smaller  than a  normal  Rubio event. So much for Marco s homecoming, and so much for Mitt Romney s plan to have Marco win his home state to force a brokered convention in July.If Romney s revolt was ever going to happen, it wasn t going to be in Florida. You d think Mitt s people would ve figured that one out, but there you go (millions are beginning to understand now why Romney performed so poorly in the 2012 election).Jason Carol s cameraman delivered a dim shot of the rally. If there was a church BBQ down the road, it would have drawn a bigger crowd than this.After this debacle last week, Rubio still found the gumption to go on national TV and more or less instruct his supporters to cast their vote for John Kasich in the Ohio primary. Never before in modern American history have we seen presidential candidates instructing their supporters to vote against them in order to derail the party frontrunner in the hopes of triggering a brokered Republican National Convention in July.In reality, a brokered convention means that even if Donald Trump wins the popular votes and the collects the most delegates in the GOP primaries   the Republican Party will call for a vote on the convention floor asking for all delegates to vote again, which in this case would mean that if the combined delegates of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich exceeds that held by Donald Trump, then Trump would be dumped by his own party s establishment insiders at the convention  in favor of another yet to be determined party elite selection. Most likely this would be Mitt Romney s former running mate, House Speaker Paul Ryan, or one of the other three aforementioned candidates.Great on PaperBefore he was cast-off by the Tea Party purists in favor of Cruz, Rubio had positioned his brand as one of insurgency, but the crowd didn t buy it. So the brand was repositioned as a  safe  choice for voters.When the Rubio vs Trump m l e first started, I had said that this was the inevitable result of the Republican establishment who were,  going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be Marco Rubio, with Wisconsin s Scott Walker throwing early innings in the bull pen. Orthodox RNC thinking last spring believed that Rubio, with less than one term in Senate and no leadership experience, would somehow repeat the  Obama effect  of 2008, and finally usher their party into the 21st century. Things looked very different for Hillary last spring too, where she seemed invincible on the Democrat side as well as in national polling. On paper at least, it seems that Rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the GOP elite presiding over a party in decline and disarray   young (44 years old, although you d put him at a decade his junior), and even more importantly, Latino, giving the GOP a shot at pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment: Hispanic-American, independents and moderate Democrats. On paper this all makes perfect sense, but running for President in the United States of America isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper. Case and point: Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson and, of course, Donald Trump. It was a truly devastating moment for the Rubio campaign who had raised no less than $70 million so far as part of a desperate establishment bid to market the  Rubio brand . According to a chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Rubio has been  more hyped than Crystal Pepsi,  in reference to Pepsi s 1992 marketing flop. Sen. Rubio has been more hyped than Crystal Pepsi, but he has flopped even worse,  said Weaver last week. Even a well-conceived, high-financed marketing campaign won t work if people don t want to buy the product. That s the Rubio campaign s problem . Behind the nice packaging, voters are discovering there is little substance. Not surprisingly, I don t really like Crystal Pepsi. No one does. But everyone remembers when Coca Cola tried to inflate New Coke, Cherry Coke, and finally Coke Zero, before it completely flopped. Millions were wasted in vain, and it seems that the only people who really benefited from this exercise in hype were the advertising agencies and the production companies who produced them   and also the media networks who sold the ad space to Coca Cola.The same could be said with Rubio, and of course with Jeb Bush and a few others, although Rubio may still live to run another day. Coke didn t give up on Zero. Zero eventually became a Hero (well, according to Coca Cola, anyway) after years and years of marketing capital was invested into that product  which no one was really interested in to begin with.Billionaire Boys ClubBillionaires love to gamble, especially in politics   and they gambled heavily   and lost, on Marco Rubio. One might question the establishment s efficacy in leaving an invisible Rubio in a primary race where he s taking votes away from a more promising challenger in Texas Senator Rafael Edward (Ted) Cruz. Ditto with Kasich.Maybe it s the egos, or maybe Trump is actually pulling the master strings. Either way, the establishment s anti-Trump obsession is tearing the Republican Party apart.Just when you thought it couldn t get any more like a true life black comedy, all three desperate GOP challengers found themselves courting the endorsement of election dropout and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, on the Thursday before the CNN debate began.As sexy goes, this endorsement hardly registers outside of a few select country clubs. If it were an endorsement from 90 year old Barbara Bush then it might mean something.So poor was Jeb s showing in the primary contest   even after burning through over $100 million in campaign donations (he raised over $150 million) and received around 7% of the vote   it s difficult to see why anyone among Rubio, Cruz and Kasich would be offering a stump for Mr. Excitement, a  low energy  dynastic nonstarter.On balance, this endorsement would probably garner less votes than an endorsement from David Duke. Such is the bizarre and sideshow-like nature of this 2016 presidential election. A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY: Rubio uses Neocon s PNAC and  Israel-first old marketing slogan.Why the Elite Loved RubioLike his globalist colleague Kasich, and despite his evasive comments on the campaign trail, Rubio seems very committed to Wall Street and Bilderberg principles regarding corporate-brokered trade pacts like TPP, TTIP, GAT, and the WTO.On foreign policy, Rubio is a pro-war Republican, calling for regime change in Syria, and even made the incredible comment during one of the GOP s February debates that,  We didn t overthrow Gaddafi, the Libyan people did , having not realized that months of US air bombardment, as well as arming and working with Islamist militants on the ground is what toppled the Libyan state in 2011. Many of these same militants packed up and moved the roadshow to Syria in late 2011 and early 2012. The CIA were active and involved in the repatriation of fighters to Syria and the trafficking of weapons into Syria after the fall of Gaddafi. It would be shocking if Rubio wasn t aware of any of this, especially if he wants to be president of the United States.The other obvious, if not bizarre indicator that the globalists billionaire, military industrial class were firmly backing Rubio was hidden in plain sight. His campaign slogan was  A New American Century , and of course, the significance of this was completely lost on the mainstream media. It seemed that Rubio had stolen his campaign slogan from the likes of Donald Rumsfeld and John Bolton (and Jeb Bush, who also signed the PNAC pledge in 1998) whose neoconservative pro-war think tank, Project for A New American Century (PNAC) was arguably the architect of America s post-9/11 foreign policy. PNAC was also an extension of Israel s foreign policy too, which makes sense considering how aggressively Rubio advocates for Israeli interests.When you actually look at Rubio s record during his time in the Florida legislature, it does not paint a pretty picture at all.Without too much effort, any member of the media, including CNN s Don Lemon, Jake Tapper or Anderson Cooper, could find a substantial trail of dirt behind the young Senator   if only for the fact that Rubio s record seems to be off limits by the media and newspapers like the New York Times   all of whom are devoted to only running critical exposes on Donald Trump. Rubio s dubious track record of scandals and other pieces of corruption are well-known in his home state, but almost invisible nationally. Top of that list might be one David Rivera, a long-time political ally and close friend of Marco Rubio   who also happens to be under investigation by the FBI.That s only the beginning. One of the most telling scandals involved Rubio selling his home to a lobbyist, and getting way over the asking price. On The Issues reports: Rubio s personal finances were questioned because he made a $200,000 profit selling a house he owned to the mother of a chiropractor who was lobbying for a change in state insurance rules. Rubio had been a holdout, but removed a block on the measure shortly after the home sale and voted for it. Rubio was criticized for failing to disclose a home equity loan he received from US Century Bank, whose chairman, Sergio Pino, was a political supporter. The house had been appraised for $185,000, more than the purchase price just 37 days after he bought it. Rubio s staff said the value jumped because he d locked in a lower preconstruction price and made improvements. US Century Bank a large recipient of federal bank bailout money denied making a sweetheart deal. There are a number of other sketchy scandals linking Rubio to Florida s organized crime syndicates, ponzi schemes, including shady deals involving cash payouts and dodgy lobbyists, some of which can be read here. The mainstream media never challenged Rubio on any of these reports, so Rubio never had to defend against them.Then there s the business of Rubio s  sugar daddy , Jewish billionaire and Israeli luminary Norman Braman. Not only is Braman bank-rolling the Rubio political machine (in return for ?), but Brahman s  charity  foundation also employs Marco s wife Jeanette Rubio too. ON BOARD: Rubio with Israeli luminary Shimon Peres.  Brahman is also Rubio s entr e into the Israeli Lobby. It was Brahman who flew Marco and his family to Israel in 2010 to be inducted into the Israeli mind-set. This is also evident through Rubio s pro-Israeli rhetoric, where during one debate he proudly announced,  There can be NO negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians right now In another recent speech, Rubio took things a step further by insinuating that anyone who criticizes Israel is racist, insisting that, All of this anti-Israel action going on globally, it s anti-Semitism. He could easily be speaking as an Israeli envoy, speaking straight off of the lobby s talking script.That s just a snapshot of what sort of political animal Marco Rubio is   not unlike the rest of the pack, and perhaps a lot more shrewd, pushy and cunning than many others. You wouldn t expect anything less by anyone who believes that they deserve to be elected President of the United States having served less than one term in the US Senate at the age of 44.It s not certain yet whether or not Rubio will be able to retain his Florida US Senate seat after announcing he would be campaigning for president last year. Maybe a run for governor in Florida is in the cards.One thing is certain though, at his young age and with powerful backers like the Israeli Lobby   we have not seen the last of Marco Rubio. His talent and ability as a speaker and his potential for a broad-based appeal is undeniable and you can be certain he will remain a key tool for the establishment for many years to come.Just like Coke Zero, with enough marketing muscle and money injected into it, every brand can have a second life.Rubio will return.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files\n",

      "TEXT: A report just came out about the crazy huge numbers of illegals crossing our OPEN BORDER. Yes, Obama has basically opened our borders to pretty much anyone who can walk or crawl across. That means people from all over the globe including terrorists!The prospect of Donald Trump s border wall becoming a reality has illegal immigrants racing for the U.S.An investigative report by Reuters quantitatively and qualitatively shows the Republican front-runner s vow to secure the border has struck fear into the hearts of would-be illegal aliens. The news service interviewed migrants and smugglers for Tuesday s report, in addition to pouring over Customs and Border Patrol data: If Trump wins, we re all screwed and all Latinos are screwed,  Isaias Franco, a 46-year-old from El Salvador who was deported from the United States late last year and is now trying to get back, said at a migrant shelter in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas.U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data shows 150,304 migrants were detained trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border between October and February, up 24 percent from the same period last year.Similar data for  unaccompanied  child migrants   those traveling without a guardian   is not yet available, but between October and January, 20,455 kids were apprehended on the southwest border, up over 100 percent from a year ago. They think they need to take advantage while they can,  said Blanca Rivera, who manages a Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, migrant shelter.She said coyotes in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa   who charge about $7,000 per person   have been telling people now is the time to leave.CBP data revealed 150,304 people were apprehended trying to illegal enter the U.S. through its southern border between October and February 2015   a 24 percent jump over the previous year. Unaccompanied minors detained illegally entering the U.S. from October to January   20,455   skyrocketed 100 percent compared to the previous year.Isaias Franco, a 46-year-old from El Salvador who was deported from the U.S. last year, told Reuters from Ciudad Juarez that he was determined to return.

Under no circumstance will Mexico pay for the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing,  he said.  Building a wall between Mexico and the United States is a terrible idea. It is an idea based on ignorance and has no foundation in the reality of North American integration. Trump has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the U.S. border and has vowed to increase fees on some Mexican visas and all border crossing cards as part of a broader plan to force Mexico to pay for the wall.

      " TITLE: Patrick Henningsen and Don DeBar Discuss Trump’s ‘Immigration Ban’ and the Media Reaction\n",
      "TEXT: Sputnik Radio s new program Trend Storm is hosted by American geopolitical analyst and writer Andrew Korybko. This week, Andrew explores what s really driving the media uproar and political protests surrounding President Trump s executive order on immigration Andrew Korybko Trend StormUS President Donald Trump s controversial Executive Order to temporarily limit the entrance of select foreign nationals to the US is becoming a larger-than-life scandal of epic proportions.Following through on yet another of his campaign promises, America s new leader has banned people from seven countries from entering the US, building off of the list of supposedly terrorist-prone countries that his predecessor first identified. The immediacy of the order caught many people off guard, and there was confusion about whether it would apply to permanent residents (green card-holders), already-vetted refugees, and individuals in transit. Almost immediately after the announcement was made last Friday, thousands of people across the US flocked to their local airports to protest the measure. In doing so, they defied what are ordinarily strict security measures, which during regular times would prohibit such large-scale gatherings at locations considered essential to the nation s infrastructure.The protesters claimed that Trump had  banned Muslims  from entering the US, and the hashtag #MuslimBan instantly started trending on Twitter. In defense of the motion, Trump and his surrogates said that most majority-Muslim countries were untouched by the temporary border restrictions, pointing out that Indonesia   the world s most populous Muslim country   isn t on the list, for example. Moreover, in a cynical retort to the critics, they reminded the public that Obama had earlier suspended the US refugee program for Iraqi nationals for half a year back in 2011, though no such protests erupted at that time. Nevertheless, it s hard for the Trump Administration to shake the social media stigma that this is a  Muslim Ban , no matter how convincingly they may argue that it amounts to nothing more than a brief review period for high-risk countries prior to the implementation of what s being called  extreme vetting.  This is because the mainstream US media is very sympathetic to what Trump and his spokespeople have termed the  political opposition,  namely, the Democratic Party.The perception management and narrative-building that these two institutions are known for was seen vividly and on full display during the presidential campaign, but it s gotten even more intense since Trump s election. Just like back then, however, it doesn t seem to be doing its intended job, since a Reuters poll released on Tuesday found that 49% of Americans are in favor of the President s action, while 41% are against it.Patrick Henningsen, Founder and Executive Editor of 21stCenturyWire.com and the host of the Sunday Wire Show, and Don DeBar, host of a syndicated daily radio newscast CPR News heard across the US, commented on the issue  .

      " TITLE:  This Method Has Predicted Every Modern Election And Trump Is Screwed\n",
      "TEXT: It s not about polls, it s not about personalities, it s not about unfavorable (or favorable) ratings, it s not even about policy. Moody s, who has predicted every election since Reagan in 1980, says that the Democrat will win the White House and the odds are getting progressively worse for Trump.According to Moody s, it s the economy. It s always the economy, and despite Trump s insistence that we are stuck in an apocalyptic nightmare of 40 percent or more unemployment, people are pretty happy overall, which favors the party in office: Democrats.It s a bad sign for Trump. Moody s has been predicting a Democratic triumph since last August, but the margin of victory is getting bigger for the left as the economy has stayed relatively strong and President Obama s approval rating has risen.The reason a Democrat will win isn t about polling or personalities, it s about economics, says Moody s. The economy is the top issue in just about every election. When the economy is doing well, the party currently in office usually wins again. When the economy is tanking, Americans vote for change.So far, the U.S. economy is chugging along. It s growing. Millions of people are getting jobs, home prices are rising and gas is cheap. All of this favors Democrats. The bad thing is that this puts Trump right in his comfort zone. Just two years before the housing collapse, Trump, on the Howard Stern Show, actually hoped that the real estate market would collapse. You can bet that he s hoping something similar for 2016.Right now, Moody s says the thing most likely to put a wrench in Democrats  plans is if the price of oil was to dramatically rise. Nationally, that level would have to be about $3.00 per gallon. Right now, the national average is about $2.31, which Americans are pretty comfortable with.The other thing Americans are comfortable with, which bodes well for Democrats, is President Obama. His approval rating is over 50 percent for the first time in three years. If it holds at current levels, the two-year increase in the president s approval rating running up to the election would surpass even that of President Ronald Reagan at the end of the Cold War,  notes Moody s.Best yet, the swing states are all looking pretty good. Moody s predicts that Virginia, New Hampshire, Ohio, Florida, Colorado (no wonder Republicans hate legalized pot, it helps the economy and helps Democrats win) and Nevada will all swing for the Dems. North Carolina should go Republican unless the transgender bathroom laws get enough Dems to the polls.Featured image via Joe Raedle at Getty Images (Clinton)/Isaac Brekken with Getty Images (Trump)\n",

      " TITLE:  Trump Stoops To A New Low: My Rallies ‘Are The Safest Places A Child Could Be’\n",
      "TEXT: Looking back at all of the offensive, ridiculous things that Republican front runner Donald Trump has said over the past few months, it seems that Trump would probably have a more promising career in stand-up comedy than politics. But unfortunately for the rest of us, Trump is still a leading presidential candidate for the Republican party and continues to say more insane, delusional nonsense every day.One of the latest Trump ramblings reveals just how little Trump cares about the safety of America s youth. Maureen Dowd recently wrote a column about the front runner, pulling from a recent interview she had with Trump. Like every interview the business mogul partakes in, it s absolutely insane.Trump performed his typical bullying tactics, from insulting  total whack job  Megyn Kelly and attacking Elizabeth Warren   before hilariously denying that he was a misogynist or racist. Trump said, Honestly, I m with the people. The people like Trump.  While that s pretty bad, the most shocking part of the interview came when Trump spoke about his rallies, which have become infamous for their violence.Despite the fact that he has absolutely encouraged violence at his rallies and even promised to protect his supporters if they attacked a protester, Trump continues to deny that his campaign events are anything but peaceful. In fact, over the last few days he has blamed the outrageously rabid behavior of his fans on both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Trump s dishonesty and delusion run so deep that when Trump was asked if parents should be concerned about bringing their children to rallies where cursing, physical assaults and bullying are par for the course, Trump said this: The rallies are the safest places a child could be. Trump was then questioned about a particular incident in which a man rushed the stage, causing him to visibly quiver in fear. Trump, denying that he felt he was in any danger at all, said, I got credit for that because it looked like I was moving toward him.  He also said that when his protesters scream at  agitators  or protesters,  it adds a little excitement. Clearly, Trump s rallies are NOT a safe place for a child, and it s terrifying that Trump is denying this and ENCOURAGING his supporters to bring their kids into such a chaotic, unstable environment. The scary thing is, Trump s supporters hang on to his every word and are probably too dense to know any better.While Trump continues to deny that his rallies are extremely dangerous, several more incidents of violence happened at a Tuscan, Arizona rally yesterday   ironically the same day that Dowd s column about Trump was published. During the rally, a man was punched, kicked and stomped on the ground, and Trump s own campaign manager was seen grabbing the collar of a protester. Previously, Trump s campaign manager was accused of assaulting a female reporter.And those are not isolated instances. This type of violence follows Trump everywhere he and his protesters go. These attacks are sometimes racially motivated, and sometimes for no reason at all (attacks on peaceful protesters have become quite common). Suggesting that parents expose their children to the type of bigotry, racism and all-around disgusting behavior that we ve seen from Trump and his minions is despicable. Through his denial and lies, Trump has greatly endangered America s youth.Featured image via Gage Skidmore\n",

      " TITLE:  Republican Senators Don’t Want Ted Cruz Anywhere Near Their Re-Election Campaigns\n",
      "TEXT: Ted Cruz thinks he could be an asset to the campaigns of his fellow Republican senators. There s just one problem, though: most of them don t like him.Republicans currently face an uphill climb this year, especially with Donald Trump at the top of the 2016 ballot. The nomination of Trump presents a major problem for Republicans who hope to keep their seats or take seats away from Democrats.Indeed, instead of riding Trump s coattails to victory, Republicans are looking at down-ballot rejection as people associate them with the Republican nominee and his vile campaign.Despite being destroyed by Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz wants to lend a hand to his colleagues. That can go a long way toward establishing good relationships,  one Cruz adviser told The Hill.  At the same time, though, I d be wildly surprised if he suddenly started moderating his principles just to get along. Establishing good rapport with colleagues is incredibly crucial to running for higher office. But Ted Cruz has alienated and pissed off most of his Senate colleagues because of his aggressive losing strategies in recent years, the biggest of which is undoubtedly the government shutdown in 2013.Cruz incited the shutdown because he thought it would force President Obama to dismantle Obamacare. In the end, it was a PR nightmare for Republicans as the American people rightfully blamed them for shutting the government down.But the Cruz adviser thinks his colleagues will be interested in taking Cruz s help. I think politicians are practical people,  he said.  They re going to be pretty interested in the kind of support he can give them I think fewer people would say they don t want him now. Unfortunately for Cruz, he seriously underestimates just how much his colleagues loathe him.As it stands, incumbent Republicans facing tough re-election battles don t want Ted Cruz making their lives more difficult.When asked by The Hill if she would accept help from Ted Cruz, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said,  Uh, no. I don t think I d ask anyone to come up, generally, other than I had [Sens.] Joni [Ernst (Iowa)] and Shelley [Moore Capito (W.Va.)] up,  she continued.  This is about me campaigning for New Hampshire. I m going to be focusing on my campaign for me. It s not a reflection on him, or anyone else he hasn t contacted me, but I m sure there s a lot of different races out there. In other words, please don t come to New Hampshire, Ted.In Pennsylvania, Senator Pat Toomey also faces a tough campaign, but that doesn t mean he wants Cruz there to make it worse.[Cruz is] not going to [be] into what my campaign is doing,  Toomey insisted.And then there is Arizona Senator John McCain, who has famously referred to Cruz as a  whacko bird.  Yeah, he definitely does not want Cruz stumping for him in his home state.McCain said he only seeks help from people he is close to.  I m not close to Sen. Cruz,  McCain declared.So it looks like many Republicans would rather not have Cruz s support, which isn t surprising considering how extreme he is on several issues.Frankly, if Cruz wanted his colleagues to be more enthusiastic, perhaps he should have thought about that before becoming the most annoying voice in the Senate.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n",

      " TITLE:  Why The Latest Email Revelations May Help Clinton, Not Hurt Her\n",
      "TEXT: On Thursday, the Inspector General of the State Department released a stinging report on Hillary Clinton regarding the use of her private email server. As expected, republicans pounced on the  findings  in an effort to paint her as an incapable, dangerous criminal (like they haven t already). Democrats, on the other hand, are taking a different approach and surprisingly have a strong defense from the conservative Forbes. Saying the newest findings in the  email-gate  vindicate rather than harm her, contributor Charles Tiefer, who served as Solicitor of the House of Representatives and as an attorney for the Senate Legal Counsel, says the  scandal  may not lie with Hillary Clinton but really with the Bush Administration:It does not add any new serious charges or adverse facts. And, it shows she was less out of line with her predecessors, notably Colin Powell, than has been charged. Powell s handling of his email was so similar, in fact, that when House Republicans drag this issue through hearings up to Election Day, Powell should be called as a witness   a witness for Clinton. To put it differently, she is having a double standard applied to her.If there is any person in the history of American politics that is the poster child for having double standards applied, it would be Hillary Clinton. For obvious reasons (she s a woman), Clinton seems to bear the brunt of rage from people who remain silent when men (or members of their own party) do the exact same thing: embassy security; mere ambition; votes (think crime bill); paid speeches; and now email procedures.Once again, Hillary Clinton is put on blast for an 83 page report, in which only half a dozen pages actually address the Secretary s personal emails   the rest of the pages are appendices, historical context and precedence established by predecessors including Albright, Rice, Powell and now Kerry. And the few pages that do mention her emails mostly discuss broad cyber security policies pertaining to emails.No new information has come out of the report. Just a scathing slap on the wrist for Clinton, who has already admitted that she could have gone about a much better way of handling her emails. But still you ll find Republicans (and indeed some left wing liberals) cry out  smoking gun.  As Tiefer points out:[T]o the extent that she is criticized because  she did not comply with the Department s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act,  the report is making a legal judgment that is not particularly strong. Note how she is not labeled as violating any statute, but rather, a real mouthful of mush    the Department s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.  So we are talking about obscure, dull, bureaucratic policies. Not a criminal statute. Not even a civil statute   just the bureaucratic policies.The fact of the matter is that this is not a smoking gun   just a politicized report of things we already knew. Based on the IG s report, Clinton did nothing illegal, she just created a bureaucratic headache. Shouldn t Republicans be giving her a medal given their intense hatred for the rules and procedures established by bureaucracy?So how does this help her? Well, for starters, it doesn t really hurt her. There s no legal framework established for an indictment, yet (unless we are counting on the FBI or the DOJ to somehow find a smoking gun). Second, it s more ammo for Clinton to use against a very sexist double standard that is applied to women in politics and not men. Third, it s another light shone on the Bush Administration, a penchant for lies, crooked shenanigans, and again, double standards.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n",

      "TEXT: While Donald Trump officially assumes the office of President on Friday, he says he ll be leaving the Oval Office chair empty until Monday. According to Trump, he ll spend the weekend partying instead of presidenting.In an interview with the Times of London, Trump said,  One of the first orders I m gonna sign   day one   which I will consider to be Monday as opposed to Friday or Saturday. Right? I mean my day one is gonna be Monday because I don t want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration, but one of the first orders we re gonna be signing is gonna be strong borders. Note, this is the same man who once said about President Obama,  It was reported today he played 250 rounds of golf and he s going to be in Hawaii, I think did they say for three weeks?  Trump said.  Two hundred and fifty rounds, that s more than a guy who plays in the PGA Tour plays. He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. We don t have time for this. We have to work. While 250 rounds might sound like a lot, over eight years, that amounts to less than one round every 10 days. Historically, though, 250 rounds is a tiny blip. Woodrow Wilson played nearly 1,200 rounds during his administration and George W. Bush had Obama beat in vacation time.Trump s announcement probably won t sit well with his sycophants whose hopes hung on the 21 things he promised he d do on day one.

      " TITLE:  Three Liberal Female Supreme Court Justices Slam Texas GOP Over Anti-Abortion Bill\n",
      "TEXT: The United States Supreme Court is currently debating one of the most important bills on abortion in the past two decades.The bill from Texas, which former Democratic Texas State Senator Wendy Davis famously filibustered in 2013, would grant doctors admitting privileges at hospitals for abortions, and clinics would be forced to upgrade facilities to hospital standards, which would force abortion clinics outside of highly populated metropolitan areas to close their doors, leaving about 10 clinics left in the state.Three female supreme court justices, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan led the questioning against Republican Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller over the impacts the bill would have, particularly on women from low income backgrounds.The debate is the first major decision in the United States Supreme Court since the death of Antonin Scalia. As one seat on the Supreme Court remains unfilled, a 4-4 tie over the bill is very likely. If that were to happen, the bill would be allowed to go into effect in Texas, but not set a precedent nationally. If a split occurs, the debate could also be brought back to the Supreme Court when the seat is filled.When Keller made the argument some abortion clinics would still allow to be opened in the state, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg rebuked,  How many women are located over 100 miles from the nearest clinic?  Keller cited New Mexico as a location for some women under that category to use, which Ginsburg then pointed out New Mexico does not have the same provisions as the Texas law. If your argument is right, then New Mexico is not an available way out,  she said.Justice Elena Kagan cited the Texas bill would disenfranchise over 900,000 women who live 150 miles away or more from an abortion clinic in the state. She also cited 750,000 women live more than 200 miles away, but before the law was passed in Texas, that number was 10,000.Justice Sotomayor challenged Keller over whether the changes would yield any slight health improvement, and if that was worth burdening the lives of millions of women in Texas.The Justice who could break the 4-4 tie is Anthony Kennedy, whose vote could either strike down the bill 5-3, or give the conservative justices the 4-4 tie to keep the debate open, which would give the GOP even more incentive to stall a Supreme Court Justice nomination from President Barack Obama.The past few years, Texas  GOP has led a legislative war on abortion clinics. Under the guise of improving women s health and safety, the bill is just another measure to make it more difficult for a woman to undergo an abortion by eliminating access. Prior to 2014, there were 40 abortion clinics in the state. After some provisions of the anti-abortion law went into effect after it was passed in 2013, the number was cut in half. If the bill is allowed to pass, the number would drop down again to ten, all solely located around Texas  biggest cities.The Supreme Court is expected to come to a decision by late June.Featured image via Addicting Info\n",

      "TEXT: If you live in Wisconsin and want your working neighbors to fund your existence, you may need to start peeing in a cup to prove your dependency on the government isn t related to your dependency on drugs. The governor of Wisconsin is a love em  or hate em  kind of leader. Conservatives love him for making public sector unions pay more of their own benefits,  liberals hate him for daring to stand up to the powerful, organized mega-donors of the Democrat Party. Governor Walker is about to shake things up again in the blue state of Wisconsin, and liberals are not gonna be happy Gov. Scott Walker is moving forward with an effort to drug test some food stamp recipients, with testing expected to begin in as little as a year absent action from lawmakers or the federal government.Wisconsin s Republican governor has submitted a plan to state lawmakers for drug testing able-bodied recipients of the state s Food Share program. If the state Legislature doesn t object within 120 days, the plan will go into effect, though it will take at least a year for actual testing to begin.The program won t necessarily have a massive effect, however. The Walker administration estimated in October that only about 220 food stamp recipients statewide   or just 0.3% of able-bodied adults   would test positive in the first year. Employers have jobs available, but they need skilled workers who can pass a drug test,  Walker said in a statement.  This rule change means people battling substance use disorders will be able to get the help they need to get healthy and get back into the workforce. A year ago, Walker had asked then President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration to clear the way for the change in the food stamp program, which is overseen by the state but largely funded by federal taxpayers. So far that hasn t happened but a Walker spokesman said Monday that the governor believes the state can proceed without any federal action. Our position is we have the authority to implement the rule,  spokesman Tom Evenson said.The now-departed appointees of President Barack Obama didn t see it that way. In January 2017, right before Trump took over the White House, the former U.S. official in charge of the replacement program to food stamps said such testing would require a change in federal law. The law clearly does not allow it,  said Kevin Concannon, undersecretary at the federal Food and Nutrition Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Walker s  office forwarded that request to us and it was very clear, we consulted the legal counsels here and the law absolutely does not allow it. The Trump administration, however, may not see the issue in the same light.   Journal Sentinel \n",

Investigators want to determine whether the amateur president s son-in-law was vulnerable to Russian influence during and after the campaign because of financial stress facing his family firm s signature real estate holding   a Manhattan skyscraper, ABC News reports.Before the election, Trump s mounting conflicts of interest disturbed many of us, but Republicans said it was no problem to put a an alleged billionaire who won t release his taxes at the helm. So, here we are.Officials told ABC News that the investigators are particularly interested in a December meeting Kushner held with executives from a Russian bank. It s very peculiar that of all the people he could be talking to in a transition period where you ve got lots of balls in the air, that you end up talking to a Russian banker who is under sanction and who is related to Putin and has a KGB background,  said Rep. Jackie Speier (CA-D), who sits on the House Intelligence Committee.  I think the question has to be asked, was this about you trying to get financing for your troubled real estate that you have in New York City? Who amongst us has not held meetings with Russian bankers? Let them cast the first stone, k?ABC News reports:The timing of Kushner s December meeting with executives from VneshEconomBank, or VEB, at the suggestion of the Russian ambassador, has also raised concerns from government watchdog groups across the political spectrum.Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, (which was founded by Trump adviser Stephen Bannon and funded in part by a Trump mega-donor, Rebekah Mercer), said the meeting  had conflict of interest written all over it. (my bold, because damn) You worry about a quid pro quo, you worry about Kushner getting some financial arrangement from a Russian financial institution, and you worry about White House policy being shaped in a way that benefits either those banks or Russia at large,  Schweizer said.  That s the concern. Hey, and that comes from a group founded by President Bannon and is partly funded by the Mercers. It s almost as if Kushner is considered collateral damage at this point.ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos asked White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Friday to explain Kushner s meeting with Gorkov (by the way, Kushner also met with Sergey Kislyak, but we ll get into that in a bit), but she repeatedly refused to do so.  Jared has said that he s willing to go and share whatever information he has,  Conway said.  He actually has made that clear for many months now, and he looks forward to doing that. Jared owes a bigly amount of money and it s due in just a couple of years:Real estate analysts told ABC News that Jared Kushner s first major acquisition, a Fifth Avenue office tower signifying his family s move from New Jersey into Manhattan real estate, is shouldering a $1.3 billion in loans coming due in two years, and it is not bringing in sufficient rental income. An attempt by Kushner to broker a deal with a Chinese company to refinance and redevelop the building fell through shortly after the election.Thomas Fink, a senior vice president at the firm Trepp, which analyzes commercial real estate, described the Kushner firm as being unable to write a $1.3 billion dollar check. I don t think they have a billion plus in the bank to just write a check to pay off the mortgage,  Fink said.  Potentially they could sell the building, but you know, what will someone pay for it  that remains to be seen. The Russian state-owned bank and the White House have different explanations for Kushner s secret meeting during Trump s transition period.Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that the FBI and Congress are examining a campaign event last spring during which Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner were in a small gathering with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak and other diplomats at Washington s Mayflower Hotel.It seems like everyone in the Trump administration has secretly met with Kislyak, a known Russian spy recruiter. Again, that s totally not suspicious. Haven t we all met Kislyak, an oversized Russian, then forgot about that covert meeting?Stuff you can t make up: The address of Kushner s building is 666 Fifth Avenue. The orb, the sinkhole, and now the 666 building. Lol.Photo by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images.\n",

      " TITLE:  Joe Biden: I’m Not Part Of The Party That Says ‘Well We Can’t Do It’\n",
      "TEXT: On April 23 Vice President Joe Biden cast his vote in the Democratic presidential primary, in his home state of Delaware, but declined to say which candidate he voted for.Neither the president or Vice President has publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2016 race, but during an interview with The New York Times, published on Wednesday, might provide some insight into which way the vice president was leaning on Friday.The New York Times reported:He remains neutral in the battle between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, but not between their campaign styles. He ll take Mr. Sanders s aspirational approach over Mrs. Clinton s caution any day.During the interview Vice President Biden told The New York Times reporter John Harwood: I like the idea of saying,  We can do much more,  because we can. He went on to compare the candidate s very different approaches to their campaigns, saying: I don t think any Democrats ever won saying,  We can t think that big   we ought to really downsize here because it s not realistic. C mon man, this is the Democratic Party! I m not part of the party that says,  Well, we can t do it.   The New York Times also reported that the Vice President likes the idea that Mr. Sanders is aiming high, regardless of whether the large steps he envisions to narrow income inequality and broaden economic opportunity become realized in the next presidential term. According to the interview:The philosophy Mr. Biden has advocated within the Obama White House: Push for a lot, and persevere over the long run.Vice President Biden stressed the point, saying: Presidents have always been told by really smart people:  Don t push something that you can t succeed in   it diminishes your power. I completely disagree with that proposition. Indeed, the race between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and VT Senator Bernie Sanders is strikingly similar to the Clinton-Obama race of 2008.Then Senator Obama ran on a platform of  hope and change,  telling his energetic followers  Yes We Can. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton sought to portray herself as level-headed and realistic, warning that there is no magic wand to fix the problems in Washington.After eight years of George W. Bush, 2008 voters preferred Obama s message of bold change to Clinton s ideas for incremental change.This time around though, the 2016 electorate is leaning more toward Clinton s pragmatic approach, likely as a response to eight years of Republican obstructionism and even outright sabotage in Washington.While voters are certainly tired of budget showdowns and government shutdowns, the fact remains that as long as Republicans control Congress, both candidates will face the same right-wing extremism that President Obama has faced once they reach the White House.No democratic president is going to make Republicans in the House and Senate reasonable or even sane.Regardless of whether voters choose Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, there s no question that both Democratic candidates would be hated and vilified by the GOP.While all eyes are on the race for the presidential nomination, changing the dynamics of Congress should also be a top priority to anyone who wants to see the country continue to move forward, not back.Image credit: Wikipedia Public Domain\n",

      " TITLE: POLITICAL AGITATOR: Globalist George Soros Linked to Over 50 ‘Partners’ of the Women’s March on Washington\n",
      "TEXT: 21st Century Wire says More than 50 NGO  partners  of the Women s March on Washington were found to be tied to social movement financier George Soros. While the DC gathering was billed as a grassroots movement for women s rights in America, it was anything but as a string of multi-million dollar Democratic Party-affiliated NGO s organized what was clearly an anti-Donald Trump event following the US presidential inauguration this past week.  DIVIDE BY DESIGN    (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)As we ve stated before here at 21WIRE, this kind of political protest is designed to first cause public disruption, while also fomenting a form of socially-engineered cultural, gender and class warfare.In the case of the Women s March on Washington, a militant style of identity politics was on a full frontal display. Enter stage left   the celebrities This was never more apparent than the hate filled diatribe of Hollywood actress Ashley Judd, whose angry rhetoric was eclipsed only by famed singer Madonna, who during her obscenity laced speech admitted to harboring violent thoughts directed at the White House. Consequently, the Material Girl is now reportedly under Secret Service investigation for her bomb related threat this past Saturday.Watch how both Judd and Madonna are driven by rage during their politically divisive speeches at the Women s March on Washington https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-5ZkrQHyNcDuring an interview with ABC NEWS, Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway  didn t see the point,  of the Women s March. Additionally, Conway underscored that 29-30 million women across America voted for Trump and their voices were heard in the 2016 election https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVEiGcT9wD4QUESTION: Was the heavily organized Women s March on Washington just another example of a radical globalist and cultural Marxist  progressive  agenda at play?Historically speaking, many social movements have worked to erode the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial  color  upheavals (color revolutions), and where possible   weakening a country s national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization  color revolution  campaigns overseas, and now astute observers will recognize these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US.Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State.Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO, and UNITE HERE. These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this latest protest movement in America.While it still remains to be seen if Trump s stated political vision for America can unite an embattled nation, one thing is clear   many NGO groups operating inside the US will continue their organized opposition to the newly elected president over the course of his time in the White House.  BITTER PILL    Madonna s waning singing career gives way to cultural upheaval and demagoguery. (Image Source: Extra.ie)Other  partners  for the march included the American Atheists and UniteWomen.org, who ran a public relations campaign which featured videos with the hashtags #ImWithHer, #DemsInPhily and #ThanksObama. Once again, all road lead back to billionaire Hillary Clinton financier, George Soros and his Open Society NGO empire.Writer Asra Nomani expands on the Soros web here: By my draft research, which I m opening up for crowd-sourcing on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march s  partners,  including  key partners  Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump s anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump s environmental policies. The other Soros ties with  Women s March  organizations include the partisan MoveOn.org (which was fiercely pro-Clinton), the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as  a leader of tomorrow  as a march co-chair and another official as  the head of logistics ). Other Soros grantees who are  partners  in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. March organizers and the organizations identified here haven t yet returned queries for comment. NOTE: See her full story below.The Free Thought Project illustrates the contrived socially engineered nature behind the Women s March on Washington in lengthy passage below:Washington, D.C.   An investigation by a New York Times affiliate has revealed that billionaire globalist financier George Soros, who recently called Donald Trump a  would-be dictator  during an interview at Davos, and whose Open Society Foundation works to finance and forward progressive causes across the world, and is intimately connected to numerous color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and various other political uprisings across the globe, has been revealed to be connected to more than 50 of the groups that organized the nationwide  Women s Marches  that saw millions of Americans take to the streets across the country.The march s official website says,  We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.  Many people turned out to be a manifestation of that ideal, but it s important to understand the reality of what is happening on a strategic political level as an inorganic politically contrived and funded event. This, in no way, takes away from the validity of standing up for women s issues but is important to note that women are being used as pawns in a larger ideological political game that has international overtones of power politics.These marches were largely billed as  spontaneous  and  grassroots  actions, by publications like The Guardian and Vox. However, the reality exposed by an investigation by self-described liberal feminist Asra Q. Nomani, writing for New York Times affiliate Women in the World, revealed that after studying the  funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march, contrary to the non-partisan rhetoric used in these marches, they were not really  women s march  but were rather  for women who are anti-Trump. Nomani reveals that the  Women s Marches  were actually organized as political tools to be used to strategically forward a progressive political agenda against President Donald Trump   exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down driven political operation   and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media.

(Image Source: thefederalist.com). Asra Q. Nomani NY Times   Women in the WorldIn the pre-dawn darkness of today s presidential inauguration day, I faced a choice, as a lifelong liberal feminist who voted for Donald Trump for president: lace up my pink Nike sneakers to step forward and take the DC Metro into the nation s capital for the inauguration of America s new president, or wait and go tomorrow to the after-party, dubbed the  Women s March on Washington ? The Guardian has touted the  Women s March on Washington  as a  spontaneous  action for women s rights. Another liberal media outlet, Vox, talks about the  huge, spontaneous groundswell  behind the march. On its website, organizers of the march are promoting their work as a grassroots effort with  independent  organizers. Even my local yoga studio, Beloved Yoga, is renting a bus and offering seats for $35. The march s manifesto says magnificently,  The Rise of the Woman = The Rise of the Nation. It s an idea that I, a liberal feminist, would embrace. But I know   and most of America knows   that the organizers of the march haven t put into their manifesto: the march really isn t a  women s march.  It s a march for women who are anti-Trump. As someone who voted for Trump, I don t feel welcome, nor do many other women who reject the liberal identity-politics that is the core underpinnings of the march, so far, making white women feel unwelcome, nixing women who oppose abortion and hijacking the agenda. To understand the march better, I stayed up through the nights this week, studying the funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march. Is this a non-partisan  Women s March ?Continue the NY Times article here READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\n",

      "TEXT: Even though Senator Susan Collins voted with the Senate GOP to move the Obamacare repeal effort forward, it should be noted that during the amendment process   in which Democrats unleashed a flurry of provisions to protect those who rely on Obamacare the most   she bucked her party almost exclusively to side with Democratic proposals (members who are independent but caucus with the Democrats are considered Democrats for the sake of their proposals).Perhaps this may give a hint as to how Senator Collins will vote when the actual repeal comes to the floor.Here are the amendments Collins voted for:The Gillibrand Amendment [Kirsten Gillibrand, New York]   To protect women s health care from ACA repeal by keeping in place provisions that:The measure failed.The Brown Amendment [Sherrod Brown, Ohio]  To prevent children, especially those in low-income families, from losing coverage if Obamacare were to be repealedThe measure failed.The Casey Amendment [Bob Casey, PA]  To ban discrimination in coverage based on pre-existing conditions.The Sanders Amendment [Bernie Sanders, Vermont]   To prevent Congress from cutting Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid under an Obamacare repeal.The measure failed.The Hirono-Donnelly Amendment [Mazie Hirono, Hawaii & Joe Donnelly, Indiana]  To prevent Congress from further cutting Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid from the reconciliation process, mirrored that Sanders amendment after it failed.The measure failed.The Baldwin Amendment [Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin]   To allow individuals aged 26 or lower to stay on their parent s insurance plan.The measure failed.The King Amendment [Angus King, Maine]   To ensure access to affordable healthcare insurance for people who work in high-risk occupations like fishing, public safety (police, firefighters), forestry and farming.The measure failed.The Manchin Amendment [Joe Manchin, West Virginia]   To ensure rural hospitals and healthcare providers do not lose or miss out on crucial funding that has been established by the Affordable Care Act.The measure failed.Measure after measure, parts of Obamacare that Republicans said they  agreed  with were shot down in a vote-a-rama in the wee hours of the morning. In other words, Republicans told the public one thing and then voted another way when they thought no one was looking.Susan Collins, however, voted with the Democrats on every single amendment they offer, minus four (Menendez, Wyden, Nelson and Kaine s amendments). Democrats offered 12 amendments, and Collins voted for eight.All of these amendments were no brainers. Yet in three of the eight, Collins was the only Republican to side with the Democrats. In four, she was one of two. The only Democratic amendment that saw more than two Republican votes was Manchin s, which received four.Collins has not yet responded as to why she voted for the final passage of the resolution, but the fight isn t over yet. This is why it s important to call, email, show up in person, etc.Call Senator Collins, thank her for bucking her party, but keep the pressure up:The Hon.

      "TEXT: The CDC is investigating an outbreak of a bacterial infection linked to puppies sold through the national pet store chain Petland.The outbreak of Campylobacter infections has sickened 39 people from seven states, including Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.So far nine people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.Campylobacter can cause a gastrointestinal illness in humans with symptoms of diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. The illness typically lasts about a week and symptoms appear within two to five days after exposure. People more likely to get a severe infection include children younger than 5, adults older than 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, including those with the genetic blood disorder thalassemia or HIV or people receiving chemotherapy.Investigators say evidence indicates that puppies sold through Petland stores are a likely source of this current outbreak. The bacteria can spread through contact with dog feces. It usually does not spread from one person to another.Twelve of those affected are Petland employees from four states. The other 27 people either recently purchased a puppy at Petland, visited a Petland store, or visited or live in a home with a puppy sold through Petland before illness began.The CDC says the pet store chain is cooperating with health officials to address the outbreak.

      " TITLE: ANGELINA JOLIE HUMILIATED Barack Obama On World Stage Over Weak Leadership On Terrorism\n",
      "TEXT: It s good to know there are a few Hollywood celebrities who haven t bought into Obama s false messiah B.S During an appearance before the U.K. s House of Lords on Tuesday, Hollywood actress and human rights advocate Angelina Jolie spoke out about how Islamic State group militants use sexual violence as a means to perpetuate terrorism   and about how we need strong leadership (unlike that of President Barack Obama) to overcome this threat.Jolie s excoriating speech laid bare just how anemic and pitiful Obama s response to ISIS has been, and how ISIS is being allowed to build a society based on rape, violence, and of course Shariah law. They are dictating it as policy beyond what we have seen before,  Jolie said.  They are saying,  We should do this, this is the right way to build a society, so we tell you to rape. Islamic militants are basically building a civilization not focused on growing food or educating children, but rather on kidnapping, enslaving and raping women, to perpetuate the endless cycle of terrorism, and Obama has allowed these barbaric radical Muslims to thrive. The most aggressive terrorist group in the world today knows what we know, knows that it is a very effective weapon and they are using it as a centrepoint of their terror and their way of destroying communities and families, and attacking and dehumanising,  Jolie explained. For over 10 years, I had been visiting the field and meeting families and survivors of sexual violence who felt for so long that their voices simply didn t mater, they weren t heard, and they carried a great shame,  Jolie continued.She added that we need  a very, very strong response at this time  to stop this horrific behavior. Of course, we have been calling on Obama to make that strong response for years, but he s far more interested in race baiting back home than dealing a death blow to radical Islam.Jolie does have some measure of expertise in the matters she s speaking of. As she told the Houses of Parliament, she has been campaigning for Middle Eastern victims of sexual abuse for over a decade (H/T The Gateway Pundit).Below is an excerpt of Jolie s address, this part dealing with some of her encounters with young rape victims.https://youtu.be/KBmHnzjgwSkIt seems like Jolie is someone whose words President Obama should heed. Will our president actually take the time though to listen, learn and adjust his failed strategy against what he once referred to as the  JV team? Only time will tell   but we wouldn t want to put any money on it. Via: Conservative Tribune\n",

      " TITLE: ESTABLISHMENT GOP END TIMES? Why Republican Candidates Are Kicking RNC To Curb\n",
      "TEXT: In the real world, if your boss is damaging your ability to achieve your full potential, you start looking for a new place of employment. Why should these candidate settle for an organization who isn t representing their best interests? The 2016 GOP presidential campaigns agreed on Sunday evening to cut the Republican National Committee (RNC) out of the debate negotiation process and instead deal directly with networks moderating debates, Breitbart News has learned.Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager for frontrunner Donald Trump, confirmed to Breitbart News via phone on Sunday that the  biggest consensus  of five separate points the GOP campaigns agreed on was cutting the RNC out of the negotiations with the networks, as the campaigns would each like to negotiate with the networks directly.In response to the revelation that the RNC will be cut out of the process, RNC chief spokesman Sean Spicer the party s point man on handling debates until now said the RNC stands ready to help the candidates in any way they can. The RNC is fully committed to serving the interests of our campaigns,  Spicer told Breitbart News.  We support the best format to present their vision to lead America forward. A campaign manager with another campaign who wished not to be identified confirmed to Breitbart News that the RNC will no longer be handling debate format and that the  campaigns will take the lead  on that. The RNC will still handle basic logistics, though, that campaign manager said.The second point of agreement was that they want information from the networks on things such as qualification criteria earlier than before, Lewandowski said, and third was they want  greater parity and greater integrity  in questions. A fourth point of agreement, according to Lewandowski, was they want debates to last no longer than two hours including commercials and a fifth is they want each candidate to get at least 30 seconds apiece for opening and for closing statements. Mr. Trump has won the last three debates, and he is willing to continue to debate his opponents,  Lewandowski told Breitbart News.  However, the moderators of the debates should not be the story. Instead, the candidates  responses to questions is what the American public should hear. The meeting happened at the Hilton in Alexandria, Virginia, in Old Town on King Street just outside Washington, D.C.Most of the details of what various campaigns wanted was already made public heading into the meeting.  Ben Carson s campaign manager, Barry Bennett, was hopeful that the group could agree on one two-hour debate with every candidate onstage,  the Washington Post s Bob Costa and Dave Weigel reported.They also quoted former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee s campaign manager Sarah Huckabee Sanders, laying out a previously public demand from campaigns. One of the big goals is allowing for more substance and equal time,  Sanders said.  It does make that difficult if there are multiple candidates but the debate s capped at two hours. But the revelation that the RNC will no longer be a part of the debate process has not yet been reported until now.During the meeting, too, according to Costa and Weigel, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush s campaign manager Danny Diaz pushed unsuccessfully for Telemundo to get reinstated as a moderator something Trump would boycott. Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz recommended that Telemundo be reinstated after being dropped along with NBC,  Costa and Weigel wrote.  But the campaign of businessman Donald Trump, represented by manager Corey Lewandowski, threatened to boycott a debate if the Spanish-language network that Trump has clashed with was granted one. Telemundo was supposed to partner with NBC News, but after CNBC s horrendous moderating job in Boulder, Colorado, last week lost its upcoming debate along with partner network NBC News.This revelation also means a last-ditch effort by the RNC to keep control of the process has failed.Via: Matthew Boyle, Breitbart News\n",

      " TITLE:  Bernie Sanders Just Opened Up About Something That Will Make Conservatives’ Heads Explode\n",
      "TEXT: In a recent candid interview with the Washington Post, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders opened up about his religious faith in a way that many will probably find refreshing. Christian conservatives, on the other hand, might want to have a seat.Speaking with reporters Frances Stead Sellers and John Wagner, Sanders made it clear that not only is he not going to try to get votes by playing the religion card, he would rather politicians keep their faith out of politics altogether. As for himself, he freely admits he isn t interested in organized religion. I am not actively involved with organized religion,  Sanders said in a recent interview.Sanders said he believes in God, though not necessarily in a traditional manner. I think everyone believes in God in their own ways,   he said.  To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together. In other words, Sanders is describing himself as a humanist.In an earlier interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Sanders spoke about how his fellow man, and not a holy book, make him want to be a positive force in the world. Well, you know, I am who I am. And what I believe in and what my spirituality is about is that we re all in this together. That I think it is not a good thing to believe that, as human beings, we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people In classic Sanders fashion, he went on to pivot from spiritual musings to railing against wealth inequality. Once again, we were reminded that when Sanders claims he would rather talk about the issues that face the country rather than his faith or lack thereof, he means it.This is a radical deviation from how most American politicians approach voters. For many, particularly on the right, religious pandering is front-and-center to their campaign strategy. For proof of that, one need only to look at how many Republican candidates have held rallies at Christian universities. Several even launched their campaigns at one.How singularly focused on religion are Republican politicians? Consider this: Trump, a man whose history of divorces, intolerance, and greed would make even Jesus strain to turn the other cheek, has managed to score a key religious ally by grovelling: Evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. He couldn t wait to brag about it.Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2016Eager to compete, Ted Cruz found his own religious leader to endorse him, Pastor Mike Bickle. Unfortunately, the man turned out to be a raging anti-Semite who claimed Hitler was sent from heaven to kill Jews. The Lord says,  I m going to give all 20 million of them the chance to respond to the fishermen. And I give them grace.  And he says,  And if they don t respond to grace, I m going to raise up the hunters.  And the most famous hunter in recent history is a man named Adolf Hitler. Oops.Ironically, Sanders commitment to avoiding religion in the public square falls more in line with what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they laid out the Constitution that Republicans claim to adore. While many   but not all   of the founders were religious, they were deeply skeptical of letting religion dictate secular society and vice versa. Religion was a private matter; politics, a public one. Mixing the two diminished both.Politics aside, it s clear that Bernie Sanders is defying every rule that Christian conservatives insisted a politician must have. Far from being hurt by his openness about his lack of organized religion, Sanders is doing just fine by sticking with the issues. It seems that a genuine drive to make things better for people really does matter more than being able to say you pray really hard. On the flipside, politicians who are deeply religious, don t seem to have a better track record. Famously, George W. Bush said he spoke to God about the invasion of Iraq   either God has a sick sense of humor or the voice in his head was, in fact, Dick Cheney s.Feature image via Flickr\n",

      "TEXT: 21st Century Wire says The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is dropping all charges against an arms dealer whose weapons made it into the hands of radical Libya militants.Early this week a motion was filed by the DOJ to drop charges against an American arms dealer named Marc Turi, according to federal court records obtained by Politico.Also according to Politico: The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.   LIBYA FALLOUT    (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)In the book entitled Definitive Report by both Jack Murphy (Army Green Beret) and Brandon Webb (Navy SEAL), a close friend of Glen Doherty (one of the Americans killed during the Benghazi siege) it was revealed that Obama s former deputy NSA advisor and current CIA director, John Brennan had been directing covert black-ops in Libya as well as other parts in North Africa, prior to the siege that left four Americans dead at a compound in Benghazi.Brennan s covert operations were said to have  prompted retaliation  inside the compound in Libya   as former CIA director David Petraeus had been blackmailed into resignation by senior CIA officials.All of this information was preceded by a massive cover-up involving mainstream media, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Susan Rice and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, both of whom initially blamed the siege on a heavily propagandized YouTube film entitled,  The Innocence of Muslims.  This meme was spread on many major talk shows even though evidence failed to connect the film to the attack.In addition, the White House and President Barack Obama had many inconsistencies in their talking points about Benghazi, first labeling it a terror attack, then quickly shifting gears, denying that there were Al Qaeda operatives anywhere near the compound.US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was said to have helped manage a large gun-running operation from the  Special Mission Compound  in Benghazi, as he was also said to have helped ship guns to  al-Qaeda-linked opposition  to assist in the takedown of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi.In a Business Insider report from October of 2012, the Benghazi story dovetailed the growing proxy war in Syria: In March 2011 Stevens became the official U.S. liaison to the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan opposition, working directly with Abdelhakim Belhadj of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group   a group that has now disbanded, with some fighters reportedly participating in the attack that took Stevens  life.In November 2011 The Telegraph reported that Belhadj, acting as head of the Tripoli Military Council,  met with Free Syrian Army [FSA] leaders in Istanbul and on the border with Turkey  in an effort by the new Libyan government to provide money and weapons to the growing insurgency in Syria. As 21WIRE has previously reported in 2014,  It s worth noting here: like Libya s new militant governor of Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhadj, the Chechen terrorist group Kata ib Mohadzherin s leader Airat Vakhitov was also under US supervision for years  imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba circa 2002, after being captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Both were Belhadj and Vakhitov were released by the Pentagon only to be repatriated in the field again   back into fighting regions to organise al Qaeda-type Islamist groups   both active in countries which the US and NATO have been actively vying for regime change   in Libya and Syria, respectively. You can draw your own conclusions here about what Guantanamo is in reality, a fact which was confirmed by thePenny Lane leaks regarding the recruitment of double agents out of Gitmo. Interestingly, in a NY Times article from December of 2012 entitled, U.S.-Approved Arms for Libya Rebels Fell Into Jihadis  Hands,  we see an acknowledgement of an arms shipment at the behest of the Obama administration under the watchful eye of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   but the mainstream media appears to have provided cover for the White House and State Department by blaming Qatar for the weapons transfer to militants: The Obama administration secretly gave its blessing to arms shipments to Libyan rebels from Qatar last year, but American officials later grew alarmed as evidence grew that Qatar was turning some of the weapons over to Islamic militants, according to United States officials and foreign diplomats.No evidence has emerged linking the weapons provided by the Qataris during the uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to the attack that killed four Americans at the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in September.But in the months before, the Obama administration clearly was worried about the consequences of its hidden hand in helping arm Libyan militants, concerns that have not previously been reported. The weapons and money from Qatar strengthened militant groups in Libya, allowing them to become a destabilizing force since the fall of the Qaddafi government. The spectre of Benghazi looms large when connecting the Middle Eastern dots over the past five years.More from Zero Hedge below   TRAIL OF BLOOD    Many questions about 2012 s Benghazi terror siege remain unanswered. (Image Source: foxnews)DOJ Drops Charges Against Arms Dealer Who  Threatened To Expose  Hillary Arming Islamic ExtremistsZero HedgeIn what would under other circumstances likely be a major media spectacle, Politico reported that the Obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer whom it had accused of selling weapons destined for Libyan rebels and who had threatened to expose Hillary Clinton s talks about arming anti-Qaddafi rebels.According to a motion filed in federal court in Phoenix, the DOJ on Monday filed a motion to drop the case against the arms dealer, an American named Marc Turi. One potential reason for the surprising move is that as Politico writes, the deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.Turi was indicted in 2014 on four felony counts: two of arms dealing in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and two of lying to the State Department in official applications. The charges accused Turi of claiming that the weapons involved were destined for Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, when the arms were actually intended to reach Libya. Turi s lawyers argued that the shipments were part of a U.S. government-authorized effort to arm Libyan rebels. It s unclear if any of the weapons made it to Libya, and there s no evidence linking weapons provided by the U.S. government to the Benghazi attacks.According to Politico government lawyers were facing a Wednesday deadline to produce documents to Turi s legal team, and the trial was officially set to begin on Election Day, although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case. A Turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed Clinton and President Barack Obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of Islamic extremist militants.Making matters worse, Turi s case had delved into emails sent to and from the controversial private account that Clinton used as Secretary of State, which the defense planned to harness at any trial. They don t want this stuff to come out because it will look really bad for Obama and Clinton just before the election,  said the associate.Leery of admitting the actual truth, in the dismissal motion, prosecutors were vague saying that  discovery rulings  from U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell contributed to the decision to drop the case. The joint motion asks the judge to accept a confidential agreement to resolve the case through a civil settlement between the State Department and the arms broker.This story continues at Zero Hedge READ MORE ISIS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ISIS Files   READ MORE LIBYA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Libya FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\n",

      " TITLE:  Republican’s Excuse For Cutting Food Stamps: The Bible Says Unemployed ‘Shall Not Eat’\n",
      "TEXT: Republican lawmakers love using the Bible to dictate their policies. They especially love using it to justify pushing spending cuts to social programs   even if it means intentionally misreading their favorite passages.In Texas, Rep. Jodey Arrington decided his support for cutting parts of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program needed a bit of New Testament spin. How does one defend taking the food out of mouths of hungry people using the Bible? By cherrypicking this quote: If a man will not work, he shall not eat. During a debate on whether or not Republicans will further gut SNAP benefits, Arrington cited the biblical verse in response to a Jewish anti-hunger group pleading with Congress not to do something so foolish as to further dismantle food stamps. He probably thought he was being pretty clever.Arrington isn t the first to use the line. It s extremely popular with conservatives. So popular, in fact, that the Daily Kos once devoted an entire article to debunking the misinterpretation of the quote.What s important to understand is working was secondary in this context, this is not so much a moral decree about work, the main message is a warning not to take advantage of the Christian obligation to feed the hungry, especially if you are screwing up the church and community tasked with doing that by behaving like a twelve year-old socialite.In other words, the real meaning is to judge a man by his heart, not by his employment status. And as the Washington Post points out, in today s economy, being  unemployed  doesn t mean lazy, unmotivated, or being a leech. As the economy continues to separate between the  haves  and the  have-nots,  finding employment can be hard.The verse in question applies specifically to people who can work or otherwise contribute to society but choose not to, said theologians from several denominations who spoke to The Post. There is a perception, among some voters and lawmakers, that many adult SNAP recipients are exactly this sort of  freeloader. But policy experts say that is not the case. Many unemployed adults on SNAP simply cannot work, they say. Those include the mentally ill, the borderline disabled and veterans.Here s economist Justin Wolfers putting the sad reality of America s employment into a stunning graph:It takes a certain kind of mind to look at these trends and conclude that tax cuts for the top 1% are an urgent national priority. pic.twitter.com/6s9Jwr0a8w  Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) March 31, 2017Arrington has both biblical and economic reasons to doubt his own reasoning. Instead, his real ideology   the Church of Conservative Magical Thinking   led him to ignore it all in favor of more cuts to the poor to benefit the very richest in the country.And as if voters needed yet another reminder of why elections matter: Arrington has only been on the job two months. He was voted into office this year. He barely moved into his office and already he s going after the most disadvantaged people in his district. Hats off to his efficiency, but then, institutionalized cruelty often is.Featured image via the Washington Post\n",

      " TITLE: HOW DOES YOUR STATE’S ECONOMY RANK? Washington DC’s Ranking And #1 State May Surprise You\n",
      "TEXT: Thanks to Obama s promise to shut down the coal industry, West Virginia comes in at #50. It s also interesting to note where Washington DC ranks in the nations best economies and why.Business Insider ranked the economies of these states, and DC s, on seven measures: unemployment rates, gross domestic product per capita, average weekly wages, and recent growth rates for non-farm payroll jobs, GDP, house prices, and wages.While they didn t factor them into the ranking, they also looked at the Fortune 1000 companies that have their headquarters in each state and which industries were disproportionately important in each state. This helped us get a little more insight into what makes each state economy tick.For more details on methodology and sources, click here.51. MississippiMississippi came in last in our ranking of state economies. Chicken, soybean, cotton, and rice farming are among the state s most disproportionately large employers.Mississippi had the lowest 2014 GDP per capita of any of the states, at just $35,019, and the lowest Q4 2014 weekly wage, at $747. The rate at which both of those measures was changing were also weak: Mississippi had the second-lowest GDP growth rate, with state GDP shrinking by 1.2%. The average weekly wage grew just 2.3% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014.50. West VirginiaWest Virginia was one of just two states in which fewer people were working in June 2015 than in June 2015, with a drop of 1.2% in nonfarm payrolls over the year. The Appalachian state was also one of only three states where housing prices dropped between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, and had the biggest drop in the state housing price index, falling 3.90%. One bright spot was that GDP grew by 5.1% in 2014, higher than the national rate of 2.2%.49. AlabamaAlabama s 2014 per capita GDP of $41,127 was far lower than the US per capita GDP of $54,307. GDP growth was also slower than in other states, increasing just 0.7% in 2014. Alabama s housing market remains lackluster, with housing prices rising just 1.8% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015.48. New MexicoNew Mexico has a large mining sector: About 18,000 New Mexicans are employed in support activities for mining. The state, home to research institutions like the University of New Mexico and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, also has a disproportionately large number of people employed in science, with about 22,000 private sector physics, engineering, and biological-research employees.New Mexico s June unemployment rate of 6.4% was a bit higher than the national rate of 5.3%, and its housing market was sluggish, with home prices rising just 1.46% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015. One bright spot is wage growth, with the weekly average wage in the state jumping 4.4% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014.47. MissouriMissouri is home to 26 Fortune 1000 companies, including Emerson Electric, agricultural giant Monsanto, O Reilly Automotive, and Energizer.Missouri had a low rate of employment growth, with nonfarm payrolls growing just 0.8% between June 2014 and June 2015. The state was slightly below average on all our other metrics, like its 5.8% June 2015 unemployment rate, higher than the national rate of 5.3%.46. MaineShipbuilding and maintenance jobs are disproportionately common in Maine, home to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, one of the four main shipyards used by the US Navy. The federal government employs about 4,700 workers in these industries.Maine saw low GDP growth in 2014 of only 0.2%. Maine s housing market was also slow, seeing only a 1.07% increase in housing prices. Maine s average weekly wage of $826 was also a bit lower than the national average of $1,035.45. ArkansasWhile home to corporate giants like Walmart, which sits at the very top of the Fortune 500 list, and food-processing conglomerate Tyson Foods, Arkansas  economy overall is weaker than that of most states.Arkansas  per capita GDP was $40,924, well below the US GDP per capita of $54,307. Similarly, the state s average weekly wage of $807 was quite a bit lower than the US average wage of $1,035 per week. However, the state s wage situation is improving: Wages rose by 4.5% from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014, the fifth highest wage-growth rate among the states.44. New Jersey The Garden State is home to the headquarters of several large corporations, including Johnson & Johnson, Prudential Financial, Merck, and Honeywell International. Although Atlantic City has seen better times, about 23,000 New Jerseyans are employed at casino hotels, about three times the national rate of employment in this industry.New Jersey had some rather extreme scores on our measures. While New Jersey s GDP per capita of $61,433 and average weekly wage of $1,211 were among the highest in the country, the growth rates for these two measures were far weaker: GDP grew just 0.4% in 2014, and wages rose just 2.0% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014, much lower than the 3.5% change nationwide.43. KansasKansas  economy has huge agriculture and aerospace sectors. Among the most disproportionately common jobs in Kansas are livestock wholesalers, cattle ranchers, turkey producers, and airplane manufacturers.Kansas  over the year wage growth of 2.6% was somewhat weaker than the national rate of 3.5% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014. Job growth was also below average, with nonfarm payrolls growing by only 0.8% between June 2014 and June 2015. Despite the slow change in employment, Kansas  June 2015 unemployment rate of 4.5% was quite a bit lower than the national 5.3% rate.42. VirginiaWith its proximity to the nation s capital and several key military installations, it s not surprising that government and military activities play a disproportionately large role in Virginia s economy. About 38,000 Virginians are employed in the shipbuilding industry, and 64,000 are employed by the federal government in national-security positions.This heavy government and defense presence also shows up in Virginia s Fortune 1000 companies: Among the big companies headquartered in Virginia are the government-backed Freddie Mac, and defense contractors General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman.Virginia s job growth was mediocre and its GDP growth was weaker than most states. Nonfarm payroll jobs increased by 1.3% between June 2014 and June 2015, and the state s GDP was flat in 2014, growing 0.0%. A more positive measure for Virginia was the state s average weekly wage of $1,057, just above the national average of $1,035.41. IllinoisSeveral iconic companies call Illinois home, like airplane builder Boeing, pharmacy giant Walgreens, insurance companies State Farm and Allstate, and the troubled burger sellers of McDonald s.While Illinois  weekly average wage of $1,089 is better than that of most other states, wage growth has been slower, with wages rising just 2.8% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014.40. ArizonaAnchored by the metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona has a diverse economy. Among the most disproportionately large industries are mining, professional organizations, financial processing, and electronics manufacturing.Arizona s housing market is recovering well, with housing prices rising 6.03% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, a bit faster than the national change of 4.96%. However, the state s GDP per capita is somewhat lower than in other areas, at just $42,213, about $12,000 lower than the US per capita GDP of $54,307.39. LouisianaShipping services, sugar farming and processing, and petroleum refining and processing are three of the most disproportionately large industries in Louisiana.Louisiana s June 2015 unemployment rate of 6.4% was higher than that of most states. The state also had a below average year-over-year job growth rate, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by only 0.7% between June 2014 and June 2015.38. AlaskaMining, fishing, and seafood processing are among the most disproportionately large employers in Alaska.While Alaska s $77,477 GDP per capita was the second highest in the country, the state s GDP was one of only two that were lower in 2014 than 2013, with a 1.3% drop in economic activity over the year. The state s unemployment rate of 6.8% was the fourth highest among the states.37. MarylandLike Virginia, Maryland s proximity to Washington means a huge federal presence in the state: 15 of the 20 most over-represented industries in Maryland are federal government employers.While Maryland s $1,113 average weekly wage and $58,335 GDP per capita were both quite high, the state was one of only three to see house prices drop between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, with the house price index dropping 0.38%. This housing market weakness along with middling scores on our other metrics kept the state from rising higher in our rankings.36. PennsylvaniaPennsylvania is home to several storied US corporations, like US Steel, Comcast, Rite Aid, and Hershey. This heritage shows up in the industries that employ a disproportionately large number of workers in the state: about 13,000 Pennsylvanians work in iron and steel mills, and about 8,000 in chocolate candy manufacturing.Pennsylvania was pretty middle of the road on most of our metrics. The state s June 2015 unemployment rate of 5.4% was just above the national rate of 5.3%, and the Q4 2014 average weekly wage of $1,013 was very close to the national average wage of $1,035.35. South CarolinaSouth Carolina has a disproportionately large manufacturing sector. Various types of fabric and textile manufacturing, tire manufacturing, and fabricated metal product manufacturing all employ a higher proportion of South Carolinians than of Americans as a whole.While South Carolina s housing market was strengthening, with a 6.46% increase in housing prices between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, the state s unemployment rate of 6.6% was the sixth highest among the states, and its per capita GDP of just $39,380 was the third lowest.34. IndianaManufacturing is still a big part of Indiana s economy: About 21,000 Hoosiers are employed in motor vehicle power train manufacturing, another 34,000 in auto body manufacturing, and about 20,000 in iron and steel mills.Indiana was a mixed bag on our measures. GDP growth was sluggish at just 0.4% in 2014. On the other hand, average weekly wages grew 3.9% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014, a bit higher than the national rate of 3.5%.33. Rhode IslandRhode Island s coastal location shows up in its economy, with private marinas and shipbuilders among the most disproportionately large employers in the state.Rhode Island s unemployment rate has dropped quite a bit in recent years, but at 5.9% in June, it is still above the 5.3% national rate. Rhode Island s job creation was middle of the road, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 1.2% between June 2014 and June 2015. On a brighter note, the 4.5% rate of year over year wage growth was the fifth highest among the states.32. ConnecticutGeneral Electric, No. 8 on the Fortune 500, calls Connecticut home, as do health insurance giants Aetna and Cigna. Not surprisingly, aerospace manufacture, insurance, and financial activities are among the most disproportionately large employers in the Constitution State.While Connecticut s GDP per capita of $70,353 was the sixth best in the country, and its $1,278 average weekly wage was the fourth best, the state s house price growth of 0.40% was the fourth worst.31. NevadaThe home of Las Vegas naturally has an outsize gaming sector. About 183,000 Nevadans are employed by Casino hotels, with another 10,000 employed by non-hotel casinos and other gambling establishments.Nevada found itself in the middle of the states because of a few extreme scores on our rankings. On the positive side, the state had the second-highest rate of job growth among the states, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 3.5% between June 2014 and June 2015. The state s housing market has been recovering nicely after being slammed especially hard after the collapse of the housing bubble, with housing prices rising 10.11% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, the second-highest jump in the country.On the negative side, Nevada s 6.9% unemployment rate is the third highest in the country, and the state s average weekly wage only grew by 1.6% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014, the second-lowest growth rate among the states.30. OklahomaThe oil industry plays an outsize role in Oklahoma s economy. About 24,000 people work in the oil-and-gas-extraction industry, with another 37,000 in support activities for mining.Like Nevada, Oklahoma scored very well on a few of our metrics and poorly on others. On the positive side, the state s 2014 GDP growth rate was 2.8%, the ninth-best among the states, and the state unemployment rate of 4.5% was much lower than average. On the negative side, job growth was slow, with a 0.6% year-over-year growth rate in nonfarm payroll jobs.29. WisconsinWisconsin s association with cheese and other dairy products is no accident: Some 17,000 Wisconsinites are employed in dairy product manufacturing, 13,000 in dairy cattle and milk production, and another 5,000 in dairy product wholesale.Wisconsin scored close to average on most of our metrics. The state s June 2015 unemployment rate of 4.6% was quite a bit lower than the national rate of 5.3%, housing prices went up 5.09% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, right in line with the national change of 4.96%, and the state s Q4 2013-Q4 2014 wage growth of 3.4% was about the same as the national growth rate of 3.5%.28. MontanaMontana is a big, wide-open state, and cattle ranching is a disproportionately large industry there. Montana s 3.9% unemployment rate was the eighth best among the states, but its average weekly wage of $794 was the fourth lowest.27. KentuckyKentucky is famous for its bourbon, its horse races, and its coal. All three are disproportionately big employers in the state: About 4,000 Kentuckians work in distilleries, 1,300 in horse ranching, and 11,000 in coal mining.Kentucky fell in the middle on most of our metrics. The state saw nonfarm payroll jobs rise by 2.2% between June 2014 and June 2015, close to the national rate of 2.1%. The state s average weekly wage was a bit lower than average, however, at just $836 compared to the national average of $1,035.26. North CarolinaNorth Carolina is home to 27 Fortune 1000 companies, including Duke Energy, Lowe s, and Bank of America.Job growth was healthy in the state, with a 2.4% increase in nonfarm payrolls between June 2014 and June 2015, slightly higher than the 2.1% national growth rate. The state s 2014 GDP per capita of $48,585 was a bit below the national level of $54,307.25. OhioOhio s industrial legacy lives on. About 31,000 Ohioans are employed in motor-vehicle parts manufacturing, with another 11,000 in motor-vehicle metal stamping.Ohio s 2014 2.1% GDP growth was just below the national growth rate of 2.2%, and the state s 5.2% unemployment rate was just below the national 5.3% rate.24. HawaiiHawaii is a gorgeous state, and tourism is a big part of the economy. Hotels employ about 38,000 residents of the state, with another 7,000 employed as tour operators and in sightseeing transportation.Hawaii s unemployment rate of 4.0% was below the national rate of 5.3%, but the state s housing market was more sluggish than average, with home prices rising just 1.53%, lower than the national growth rate of 4.96%.23. DelawareDelaware has an extremely generous corporate law, and over half of US companies are legally incorporated in the state.Delaware had a high 2014 GDP/capita, at $67,075, much higher than the national GDP per capita of $54,307. However, the state s year over year wage growth of just 1.5% was the lowest among the states.22. IowaAgricultural industries are a big part of Iowa s economy. Agricultural equipment manufacturing, starch, and vegetable oil manufacturing, and breakfast-cereal manufacturing are three of the most disproportionately large industries in the state.Iowa s 3.7% unemployment rate was the fifth lowest in the country. The state s 2014 GDP growth of just 0.4% was relatively anemic, however.21. South DakotaSouth Dakota s economy still relies heavily on agriculture. Grain farming and wholesale, livestock wholesale, and cattle production all employ South Dakotans at a higher rate than Americans as a whole.While South Dakota s June 2015 unemployment rate of 3.8% was the sixth lowest in the country, the Q4 2014 average weekly wage was just $791, third lowest among the states.20. TennesseeTennessee is home to 20 members of the Fortune 1000, including shipping giant FedEx, discount retailer Dollar General, and hospital conglomerate HCA.Tennessee scored about average on many of our metrics. The state s unemployment rate of 5.7% was a bit higher than the national 5.3% rate, and the average weekly wage in the state grew by 3.5% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014, equal to the national growth rate.19. VermontCoffee-pod conglomerate Keurig Green Mountain was founded in Vermont, where it has its headquarters.Vermont s 3.6% unemployment rate was the fourth lowest in the country, but the state s 2014 GDP growth was rather sluggish at just 0.6%.18. GeorgiaTextiles are a disproportionately large part of Georgia s economy, with carpet and rug mills, fiber and yarn mills, and fabric mills all employing Georgians at a higher rate than other Americans.Georgia s GDP grew by 2.3% in 2014, slightly higher than the 2.2% national growth rate. The state s unemployment rate of 6.1% continues to be higher than that of most other states.17. Michigan Detroit still looms large in Michigan: About 46,000 residents of Michigan work in auto and light-truck manufacturing, with tens of thousands more in related industries like metal stamping for cars and power train manufacturing.Michigan s housing market has been improving, with home prices rising 6.4% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, somewhat faster than the national increase of 5.0%. The state s 2.2% growth in nonfarm payrolls between June 2014 and June 2015 was right in line with the US rate of 2.1%.16. MinnesotaMinnesota is the headquarters for 25 Fortune 1000 companies, including Target, Best Buy, 2M, and General Mills. All four of those are headquartered in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region.Minnesota s 3.9% unemployment rate was the eighth lowest among the states. The state s 2014 GDP per capita of $57,943 was a little higher than the national per-person economic activity of $54,307.15. IdahoMemory and computer-chip maker Micron Technologies   recently in the news after talk of a buyout by Chinese tech giant Tsinghua Unigroup that could draw the ire of US regulators   is based in Boise, Idaho.Idaho s labor market is looking good, with an unemployment rate of just 4.0% and a 2.6% increase in nonfarm payrolls between June 2014 and June 2015. However, the state s per capita GDP of $39,127 and average weekly wage of $782 were both the second lowest among the states.14. NebraskaAgriculture and meat production are big parts of Nebraska s economy. About 26,000 Nebraskans are employed in animal slaughtering and processing, with thousands more in grain farming, cattle ranching, and agricultural-tool manufacturing.Nebraska s unemployment rate of 2.6% was the lowest in the country in June 2015. The state s average wage rose an impressive 5.2% between Q4 2013 and Q4 2014. Despite that increase, the Q4 2014 average weekly wage was just $837, quite a bit lower than the national average of $1,035.13. WyomingOil and coal mining are a big part of Wyoming s economy. About 6,500 citizens of the state work in coal mining, 4,600 in oil and gas drilling, 4,000 in oil- and gas-pipeline construction, and 14,000 in mining-support activities.Wyoming s 2014 GDP growth rate of 5.1% and per capita GDP of $75,648 were both the third highest in the country. However, Wyoming was one of just two states to have fewer people working in the state in June 2015 than in June 2014, with the number of nonfarm payroll jobs in the state dropping by 0.7%.12. FloridaWith Disney World, Sea World, and Universal Studios all located in the Sunshine State, it s not surprising that about 69,000 Floridians are employed in the amusement and theme-park industry.Florida s housing market, one of the worst hit by the collapse of the 2000s housing bubble, has been recovering nicely. House prices went up by 8.7%, the third-fastest growth rate among the states. However, Florida is kept out of the top 10 states with its below average per capita GDP of $42,222.11. CaliforniaThe nation s largest state is home to 10% of the Fortune 1000, with 101 companies on the list having their headquarters in California. These include Silicon Valley giants like Apple, HP, Google, Intel, and Oracle, Disney, and Wells Fargo.While California s 2014 GDP growth of 2.8% was the ninth highest among the states and the house price increase of 7.5% was the fifth highest, the June unemployment rate of 6.3% was the ninth highest, hurting California s overall score.10. OregonAthletic-apparel and shoe giant Nike was founded in Oregon, where it still has its headquarters.Oregon s 3.2% increase in nonfarm payroll jobs between June 2014 and June 2015 was the fifth best in the country, and its 3.6% GDP growth in 2014 was the sixth best.9. New YorkBusiness Insider s Sarah Schmalbruch recently pointed out that New York City is the greatest city in the world, and so it s no surprise that the state economy that includes the financial capital of the US and arguably the world falls in the top 10.New York had the second-highest average weekly wage in the country, at $1,321. The state s GDP per capita of $71,128 was the fifth highest. However, the June unemployment rate of 5.5% remains just above the national rate of 5.3%.8. New HampshireThe industrial legacy of New England lives on in New Hampshire. About 7,300 residents work in electronic-instrument manufacturing, 5,000 in semiconductor and electronic-component manufacturing, and 3,700 in miscellaneous fabricated-metal product manufacturing.New Hampshire s 3.8% unemployment rate was the sixth lowest among the states, and its average weekly wage grew by a very impressive 6.3% from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014, the second highest rate in the country.7. UtahUtah is home to four Fortune 1000 companies, the largest of which is the Huntsman chemical corporation.Utah s job market is booming. The number of nonfarm payrolls in the state grew by 4.3%, the fastest growth rate in the country. Meanwhile, Utah s 3.5% unemployment rate was the third lowest.6. MassachusettsWith its several colleges and universities providing a highly educated workforce, Massachusetts is a major hub of finance and high tech. Big companies like insurer Liberty Mutual, retail giant T.J. Maxx, and defense contractor Raytheon all have their headquarters in the state.Massachusetts  2014 per capita GDP of $68,185 was the seventh best among the states, and the state had the third highest Q4 2014 average weekly wage, at $1,315.5. WashingtonTen Fortune 500 companies are based in Washington, including discount retail giant Costco, ubiquitous coffee chain Starbucks, and huge tech companies Amazon and Microsoft.Washington s housing market is doing quite well: House prices rose 7.6% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, the fourth-highest growth rate among the states. The state s 3.5% increase in nonfarm payrolls between June 2014 and June 2015 was the third best in the country.4. TexasWhile Texas has a very diverse economy, and despite turbulence in prices in the last year, oil remains a big part of the Texas story. About 103,000 Texans are employed in the oil-and-gas-extraction industry, and tens of thousands more are in related industries, like pipeline construction, mining support activities, and petrochemical manufacturing.Texas performed very well on all seven of our measures, ranking no worse than 13th in each. Particularly impressive were the state s second best in the country 2014 GDP growth rate of 5.2% and sixth best housing price increase of 6.5%.3. District of ColumbiaUnsurprisingly, the federal government is the dominant factor in the economy of the nation s capital. About 31% of workers are employed by the federal and local governments in the district.DC is quite different from the states, and it had some extreme scores on our measures. Washington came up as high in the ranking as it did because of its absolutely stunning per capita GDP of $175,253   over three times the US per capita GDP of $54,307. Also greatly helping DC s standing was its equally impressive average weekly wage of $1,696, about $375 higher than second-place New York.On the downside, the district s 7.0% unemployment rate was the second highest in the country, and housing prices fell 0.8% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015, a situation that happened in only two states.2. ColoradoDish Network, Western Union, and Chipotle are three of the 23 Fortune 1000 companies headquartered in Colorado.Colorado s housing market had the most improvement in the country, with house prices rising 11.2% between Q1 2014 and Q1 2015. The state s 2014 GDP growth rate of 4.7% was also very strong, and was the fifth best among the states.1. North DakotaNorth Dakota had the strongest economy in the country. The state s economy has seen a major boon from the rise of oil fracking in the last few years, and despite chaos in oil prices recently, North Dakota s economy remains robust.North Dakota s 3.1% unemployment rate was the second lowest in the country. The state also had both the highest 2014 GDP growth rate of 6.3% and the highest average wage growth rate of a whopping 7.1%.Via: Business Insider \n",

      " TITLE: WHY TRUMP IS RIGHT To Recognize Jerusalem As Israel’s Capital\n",
      "TEXT: After it was announced that President Trump was seriously considering moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, he was roundly criticized by the anti-Trump media. Today, Democrats have announced they are drawing up the impeachment papers. Pope Francis appealed to President Trump to reconsider his decision so as not to offend anyone. In his appeal, Pope Francis said,  Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims who venerate the holy places of their respective religions, and has a special vocation to peace.   And yawn in Gaza, where the more things change, the more they stay the same, Palestinians burned the U.S. and Israeli flags.The media will try to make everyone believe that Palestinians loved us when Obama was President, even though there is no truth to that fantasy. (See image below)Daily Mail   President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.Appearing in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv.Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital. I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  Trump said.  While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today I am delivering. When I came into office I promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking,  he said, leaning heavily on a mid-1990s federal law that demanded the embassy s relocation. We have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital   at all,  Trump added.  But today we finally acknowledge the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It is something that has to be done. Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon seems to think so. Continetti wrote the best piece on Trump s bold decision to move the embassy that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of. \n",

      " TITLE:  One Thing Changed About Obama This Year, And It Should Terrify Republicans\n",
      "TEXT: While much of the focus of the election year so far has been on Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, understandably, there has been a major change with regards to one of the key political figures in America and it has the potential to be a huge factor on the election.Since January of this year, President Obama s approval rating has seen a double digit increase. He is 12% higher now than he was then.But over the course of the year, Obama s approval numbers changed   quickly, and a lot. In Gallup s most recent weekly average, Obama is at 51-45   the exact opposite of where he was on Jan. 1 and a 12-point swing since then. He s been at 50 percent or higher in every week since March 1, save one.[ ]Looking at quarterly averages of Obama s approval, you can see how stark the improvement has been by party. Democrats have slowly looked at Obama more favorably since the beginning of 2015, but independents have begun to look at Obama much more favorably. After a sharp slide following his reelection, independents turned their opinions of Obama around at the beginning of 2014. Over the past year, that s escalated. And since ratings from Democrats and Republicans are more stable, that shift by independents moves the needle a lot.Multiple factors probably account for the dramatic change, but the improving economy and the contrast between Donald Trump s buffoonish style and Obama s leadership have to be considered. Trump is definitely having an effect among Latino voters, where Obama is up even higher than the average   almost +15%. Trump calling for a wall on the U.S.   Mexico border and describing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists is not a good look for the Republican Party.Obama has already said he will be out on the campaign trail for the Democratic nominee   most likely Hillary Clinton   and it has been decades since a sitting president used his office to campaign for his chosen successor (Gore pushed Clinton away in 2000, and Reagan was too ill to campaign for Bush in 1988, while George W. Bush was enormously unpopular in 2008 and McCain wanted nothing to do with him).A popular president who appeals to both Independents and the party base is a huge asset going into an election against an opponent who is both historically unpopular and who has built his campaign based on offending key members of the Democratic coalition (women, Latinos).Obama (and Biden) won t be a drag on the Democratic ticket. They could be the key to a huge victory.Featured image via Flickr\n",

      " TITLE: ACTIVE SHOOTER OR DRILL? The Cascade Mall Shooting\n",
      "TEXT: 21st Century Wire says There have been a string of active shooter events prior to 2016 s first presidential debate this coming week   with many incidents appearing suspicious in nature. The Guardian reports that the apparent motive still remains unclear: A 20-year-old suspect was in custody on Sunday for the killing of five people during a deadly shooting at a mall in Burlington, Washington, two days before. Arcan Cetin of Oak Harbor, Washington, a legal permanent resident who had immigrated to the US from Turkey, was discovered  zombie-like , police said, on Saturday evening after police responded to a tip-off following an intensive 24-hour manhunt. Cetin was unarmed at the time of his arrest, authorities said. Although a motive for the shooting remains unclear, authorities told local media that Cetin s ex-girlfriend had previously worked at the targeted department store but left her job months ago. The suspect had been charged three times with domestic assault against his stepfather and had been ordered by a judge not to possess a firearm, according to the Seattle Times. At a Saturday press conference, the FBI said terrorism was not a suspected motive. Memory Hole below Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn HeltonCASCADE MALL SHOOTING AN  ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILL ?Memory HoleVictim Corpses Remain in Mall OvernightWitnesses Sequestered from PressPhotograph depicts porta-potties, hugs and smiles at sceneAs we have sought to document at MHB on a routine basis,  active shooter drills  are now common occurrences across the US. Such  training  is a consequence of the heightened federalization of local and regional law enforcement.The September 23 Cascade Mall shooting north of Seattle in northwest Washington State took place shortly before 7:00PM local time, and has certain suspect features evident in photos, particularly evidence of tents and porta-potties on the scene, as observed by a MHB reader.There is an absence of footage of wounded or deceased victims in triage or being given ambulatory services away from the scene. Instead, news media were told victims remained in the mall awaiting the local coroner. The Washington Post reports, As of Saturday morning, the bodies of the four female victims were still inside the mall, Skagit County coroner Hayley Thompson said at a news conference Saturday. Thompson said when she gained access to the scene, the four female victims would be taken to Skagit Valley Hospital and undergo autopsies. Such events are reported on by major news media uncritically, thus supporting the call for strengthened gun control measures while ironically stimulating gun purchases by a public that fears such restrictions.The Cascade Mall shooting s police spokesperson for the event is Washington State Patrol s Mark Francis. A press release was issued over 18 hours after the event transpired.\n",

      " TITLE: PRESIDENT TRUMP Issues Warning To John McCain After Senator’s ‘Tough’ Speech\n",
      "TEXT: President Trump hit back at Senator John McCain in a pointed statement that should make it clear that Trump isn t playing around with globalist RINO McCain anymore. You can t blame Trump because McCain just keeps nipping at his heels with swipes trying to undermine Trump s policies. RINO McCain famously demolished the latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in a dramatic show during the vote. McCain came onto the floor at the end of the Senate vote and voted no with a dramatic thumbs down motion.McCain has been at odds with Trump since Trump questioned McCains status as a war hero. It seems McCain has had it out for Trump ever since.Another bombshell on the McCain/Trump feud hypothesizes that the Trump Dossier could have come from McCain.The latest slam to Trump happened just last night  during a speech McCain gave. McCain called out Trump s nationalism but it didn t take long for Trump to respond:President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a warning shot after Republican Sen. John McCain questioned  half-baked, spurious nationalism  in America s foreign policy.Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington that  people have to be careful because at some point I fight back.  The president added  I m being very, very nice but at some point I fight back and it won t be pretty. MANY QUESTIONS RAISED ON MCCAIN S STORY OF CAPTIVITYTrump could be referring to new questions about McCain s captivity in Vietnam. McCain has always been touted as a war hero for decades but many of the men who served when he did have raised questions about McCain.McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent 5  years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp and is battling brain cancer, offered a simple response to Trump:  I have faced tougher adversaries. In Philadelphia on Monday night, the six-term Republican senator from Arizona received an award for a lifetime of service and sacrifice to the country. In addition to recalling his more than two decades of military service and his imprisonment during the war, McCain took a moment to go a step further than the night s other speakers, who lamented what many described as a fractured political climate.MCCAIN S GLOBALIST WORD SALAD: To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems,  he said,  is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history. He continued:  We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. Former Vice President Joe Biden presented McCain with the Liberty Medal. Though members of opposing parties, the two men worked together during their time in the Senate. Former President Barack Obama, who defeated McCain in his bid for the presidency in 2008, congratulated the senator on the award in a tweet Monday night. I m grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for his lifetime of service to our country. Congratulations, John, on receiving this year s Liberty Medal,  Obama wrote.Trump said in the radio interview that McCain voted against Republican efforts to dismantle Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act.He says the vote was a  shocker.

      " TITLE: THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS Has Come To Bethlehem\n",
      "TEXT: Say it ain t so! The New York town of Bethlehem is being cleansed of all things Christmas and Hanukkah. Any and all signs of Christmas including a town sign that says Merry Christmas are gone. We can only say Bah Humbug! That little town in upstate New York shut down any hopes of happy holidays by voting to not display any  Merry Christmas  signs in public   and even taking down a banner for Hanukkah, too.The holiday hoopla followed apparent anxieties that this town near Albany   which shares a name with the birthplace of Jesus Christ himself   might appear to be favoring one religion over another.The town for years displayed a Christmas tree and a Menorah in its central Four Corners area, according to the Albany Times-Union. But it drew the line on signs that had any written messages   such as,  Merry Christmas  or  Happy Hanukkah. One resident, Elena Marcelle, bought a  Merry Christmas  sign for the town several years ago. This year, she said learned the town wasn t interested in hanging it up as usual. She asked town board members why. At first they said it was a traffic distraction,  Marcelle, 47, told the Daily News. The second reason is that they were afraid of infringing on constitutional rights. But the board had in fact voted to ditch worded displays altogether, meaning a  Happy Hanukkah  sign disappeared too.This despite a letter sent from the Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based conservative Christian group, urging Bethlehem to keep its holiday spirit alive. The irony is not lost on us that your town s name is Bethlehem,  the letter said, according to the Times-Union.Marcelle said she s amazed the town would mince words over holiday cheer. It was just a holiday greeting,  she said about her Christmas sign. I didn t ask to have a nativity scene. It would just recognize that Christmas is a holiday. The town has no law on the books banning any kind of holiday display. But town supervisor John Clarkson told The News the town s attorney warned the board this year that municipalities might get a legal lump of coal over any sign celebrating one holiday in particular. We re a municipality, not a religious entity,  Clarkson said. Advocating on behalf of any religion is one of those gray zones you don t want to get into. He said he saw no irony in Bethlehem stepping away from holiday greetings, noting that the town is at least sticking by its Christmas tree and Menorah presentations. I would say this little town of Bethlehem still has a really nice, homey holiday display,  he said.Via: NYDN\n",
